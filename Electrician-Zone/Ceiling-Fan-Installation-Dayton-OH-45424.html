With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>

The ATS prevents any back feed.” Back feed occurs when you don't turn off the power coming from the utility line and start your generator at the same time.

Low-voltage electrical system switches originally made by GE® or Remcon can be replaced with newer ones from Touch Plate but with some provisos which we explain below.

<p>If you need a bit cheaper and smaller generator to run only the most important appliances, check out Westinghouse WGen6000 instead.
