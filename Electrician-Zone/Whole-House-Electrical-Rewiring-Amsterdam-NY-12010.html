Homes today use more energy than they did 20 or 30 years ago because we have more appliances and other gadgets that require electricity. We can provide turnkey lighting analysis and engineered service solutions to meet your goals. Excess current could have been caused by: overload on the load; short circuit between the wires, grounded wires, short circuit in the load, ground in the load, voltage spike, voltage droop, etc.</p>
