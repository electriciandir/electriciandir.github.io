<p>Need a Generator Installation? In times of emergencies, portable generators provide the most economical way of supplying back up power. The lower wattage of LED lamp fixtures provides improved performance for a mere fraction of the energy use of other lighting. There is no project too big or too small for the Rawhide Electrical Services team. If there is a light, the blue wire should be connected to the black wire of the switch as well. However, if you want a different generator that is only intended for home use, then you can opt for standby generators.</p>
