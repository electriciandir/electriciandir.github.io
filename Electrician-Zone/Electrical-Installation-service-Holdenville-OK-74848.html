<p>Choose between natural gas generators and propane generators based on what's available in your area. Portable generators can handle brief power outages; they are capable of powering your essential appliances during an outage.

Likewise, check the other two fuses between L1 L3 and L2 L3. A no voltage reading would show a faulty fuse.</p>
<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem.
