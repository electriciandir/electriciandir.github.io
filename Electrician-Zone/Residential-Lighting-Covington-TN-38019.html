<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children.

Arc faults happen when electricity crosses a gap between damaged wiring such as loose, corroded, or overloaded connections in walls, appliances, and cords.</p>
<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch. If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
<p>A good electrician will offer you a entire line of surge protectors to accommodate your individual requirements and finances. However, this will not protect your electrical outlet, walls, insulation or your appliances from electrical shocks. Lastly, if you live in an area that promotes dark-sky compliance in outdoor lighting, be sure to select fixtures that are specifically rated as dark-sky compliant.
