This is facilitated only if you want to install low voltage cable lighting outdoors. There's no shame in getting someone else to do the actual wiring for you if you lack the skill or knowledge to do so. If you read the beginning of this article and immediately visualized how to do it based on past experience wiring switches and outlets, you're probably good.</p>
