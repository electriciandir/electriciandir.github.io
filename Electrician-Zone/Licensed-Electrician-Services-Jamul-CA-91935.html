Currently, 12 states and Puerto Rico have solar contractor licensing requirements. This service is provided free of charge with all service panel upgrades because the utility company needs to be sure that they have access to the power meter. However, in some cases, your electrical panel may need to be replaced altogether. The electrician may be able to cut back the damaged wiring, install a junction box, and extend the old circuit to the new electrical panel.</p>
