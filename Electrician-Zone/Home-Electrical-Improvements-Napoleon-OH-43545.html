Children are hands-on learners and will absorb the message more easily this way than by being given a lecture on the principles of electricity. LED lights all run on low voltage power. As I mentioned before, you should keep your voltage drop below 8% so you don't have a dimming effect on the last lights in your wire run.</p>
