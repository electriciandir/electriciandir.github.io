<p>Electricians need the right tools and equipment to perform their job easily and properly. A boiler feed pump being powered by two 3500 hp induction motors appears to be developing a problem. In single-family residences, the owner of the building owns the electric service panel, not the electric company. Dream Team Home Services is your home's ultimate team. Remove about 12 in. of the white outer plastic sheathing from the cable before you push it into the box (Photo 7). Use a stripping tool like ours for 12-2 and 14-2 cable, or an inexpensive ($2.50) sheathing stripper that works on all cables.</p>
