For basic generator installations we install a power inlet for your portable generator to plug into during a power outage. The fixtures are designed to withstand moisture, but calcium and lime deposits; hard water scale and dirt will build up on the lenses, dramatically reducing the light output. Not only can preventive electrical maintenance save businesses time and money, but by keeping equipment functioning properly, the risk of hazard is greatly reduced and the work environment becomes a safer place.</p>
<p>Given all this, it's no wonder that you're thinking about installing landscape lighting, although you're also likely very curious about how much such an installation is going to set you back.

Although many electricians are trained in 4-5 year apprenticeship programs, formal certificate and associate's degree programs are also available for aspiring residential electricians.

<p>Whether you are considering the use of patio lights, deck lights, lamp posts, or other types of solar yard lights, you will find that the possibilities are endless.
