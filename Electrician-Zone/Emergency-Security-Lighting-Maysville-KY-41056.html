<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets. Low voltage systems run on voltages lower than 30 volts DC (usually 12 or 24 volts) and use a 'Class 2' power source. Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments. Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>
