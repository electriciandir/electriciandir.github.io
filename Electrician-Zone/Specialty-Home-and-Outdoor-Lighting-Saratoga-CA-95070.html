Older homes weren't built to handle the electrical load our contemporary lives carry.

Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors. To modify the outlet for use as half-hot, use a screwdriver or a pair of needle-nose pliers to twist and break that small connecting tab.</p>

We provide a full range of residential and commercial HVAC services in the Livonia, MI and surrounding areas. Portable generators and home standby generators perform the same basic tasks. This can be easy when replacing a drive with an identical motor or controller. Power surges can occur anytime without notice.
