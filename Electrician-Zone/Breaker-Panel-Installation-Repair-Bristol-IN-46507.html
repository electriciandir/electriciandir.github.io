<p>This approach should be substantially less costly and troublesome than attempting to convert all of the switches in the home to 120V design - that would require re-wiring those areas in the home with new 120V wires.

<p>Your generator supplier or local electrician can do a wattage assessment, or you can ballpark it yourself with an online calculator You can also get general guidelines from national dealers such as Colorado Standby or Electric Generators Direct. Don't worry about having to be there to start and stop your Generac backup generator.
