<h2>Home Energy Savings Denton Texas</h2>
<p>First, low-voltage home systems use less electricity and are ideal for houses powered by solar and wind power. All landscape lights are backed by a limited warranty. When checking continuity of a circuit, remember that the voltage on both sides of the closed contact should be the same. All of the outlets should use a three pin plug in order to have a grounded connection.

<p>Enjoy the beauty of your landscape (and sure footing) after sunset with low voltage lighting. The transformer is what makes the system low voltage, as it takes the usual 120-volt house current and brings it down to 12 volts.
