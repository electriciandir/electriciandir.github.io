The white wire may be connected somewhere in the circuitry or it may be found at the back of the junction box.</p>
<p>These books illustrate in detail how to install receptacle circuits; sing-pole, double-pole-double-throw, and thee-way switch circuits; how to wire in major appliances; etc. When such mishaps are avoided, it makes it easy to escape unplanned and often very high expenses of repairing, or even replacing badly affected electrical devices due to small problems that would have otherwise been detected and dealt with earlier.

Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>

Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
