<h3>What to Consider When Choosing an Electrical Contractor in Port Lavaca TX</h3>

Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>Each electrical box should have a bundle of copper wires joined together with a wire nut (the yellow twist-on wire connector, pictured below).
