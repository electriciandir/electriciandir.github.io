<p>Many homeowners cannot afford to ride out a power outage without generator services. We also have certificates showing successful completion of safety training that teaches recognition of electrical safety hazards and how to avoid them. Use extension cords sparingly and check them periodically. Other firms applying for an electrical contractor's registration must employ a licensed master electrician in a supervisory capacity. In any home built before 1985, electrical wiring could be old and outdated. 2. Energy - This is a rating that tells you how much energy the surge protector can absorb before it burns out.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes. As the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to spread, Georgia Power wants to assure customers that the company has comprehensive plans and procedures to ensure a continuation of operations and service.</p>

<p>Common emergency repairs we see consist of GFI ground fault issues, breaker repairs after a lightning storm and outlet repairs due to circuit problems. When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current).

Whether via phone or in person, we're happy to assist you in planning your landscape lighting system. Having fewer fixtures on a single run of cable will allow each fixture in a series to draw more current. Installing new appliances should also come with upgrading your breaker panel. Low voltage landscape lights are also an excellent choice to save energy and will keep your night bright without wasting electricity.</p>
