<p>Portable generators cost $500 to $1,500 depending on power output. In general, a 100 Amp panel is usually sufficient for an average house with average electrical demands. Most electrical accidents around the house happen when people use electricity near water. According to the BLS, electricians with a wide variety of skills and certifications will have the best job opportunities in coming years. Lastly, use bollard lights in place of pathway lighting anywhere you need extra illumination for safety or direction.</p>
<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>

Unlike small standby generators that can only use natural gas or propane, whole home generators also have a diesel option which makes power more accessible.</p>
