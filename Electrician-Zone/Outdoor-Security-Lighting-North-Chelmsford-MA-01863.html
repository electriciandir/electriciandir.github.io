Sparks - Sparking coming from your fuse box, breaker panel, or outlet indicates that you're in need of immediate electrical repair. Using transformers and beautiful lighting fixtures, you can magically transform your property during night time and transform building, trees, shrubberies and other landscape features into dramatically highlighted focal points.</p>
