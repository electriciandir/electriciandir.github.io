<p>A generator is a valuable appliance in the event of a power outage. While standby generators are permanently installed on concrete pads, portable models can be easily moved from one place to another. The panel is organized so that each room or area of your home has its own breaker, improving the safety and efficiency of the system. This section primarily covers the Limited Licensed Electrician (LLE) license requirements which is required in many counties to perform work on a project where the cost is less than $25,000. Our Integrated LED Lighting Fixtures are built durable to last a lifetime, using Solid C360 & C230 Brass or 6061 Stainless.</p>
<p>Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system.
