You're in your business, and you're darn good at it. Unfortunately, that means that many (or most) electrical contractors all look the same. Generally, the more joules the better, as this means the device can handle one large surge, or multiple smaller surges, before your gear is in danger. I installed some LED tape lighting around the door of a pantry and used bell wire I think it was labeled.</p>

<p>By investing in a professionally installed whole-home surge protection, you can protect your investment. A good electrical contractor will become familiar with your home's systems and possibly discover emerging problems before they become major situations. Basic demographic information regarding individual contractors presents some the most significant statistics for the future of electrical contracting. Modern surge protectors use metal oxide varistors (MOVs) to shunt power surges.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot.

If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>
