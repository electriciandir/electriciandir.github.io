Security - Lighting meant for security is either going to be on consistently during night time or will be on a motion sensor to turn on whenever movement in a certain area is detected. Inverter generators tend to cost roughly double an open frame. Landscape lighting adds instant curb appeal to any residence or business. If at any point you elect to change electricity providers, your Reliant Surge Protect coverage will continue unless you choose to cancel this service separately.</p>
