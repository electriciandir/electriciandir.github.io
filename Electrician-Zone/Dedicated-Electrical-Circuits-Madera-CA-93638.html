<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out.

If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade.
