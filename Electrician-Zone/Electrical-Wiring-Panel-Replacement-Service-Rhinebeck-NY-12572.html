You should have the white from the panel and a jumper from the black to the panel connected to the outlet, on opposite sides. If you did not snip the tab on the second (or third or fourth) outlet, it will cause all outlets on the circuit to remain hot all the time. Residential electrical contractors perform upgrades to home offices and home theaters.</p>
