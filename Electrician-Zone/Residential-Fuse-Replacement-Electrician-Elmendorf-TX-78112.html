The Boerne, TX commercial electricians at D'Spain Sales and Service offer quality commercial lighting services throughout the Texas Hill Country area. Older homes, mostly homes built prior to 1970, are at risk for electrical fires. Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs. We make sure that your outdoor lighting system is good as new, by conducting frequent outdoor lighting inspections and repairs, and by making sure that fixtures and glass lenses are clean.</p>
<p>Get the wiring in your home checked at least every ten years and make sure that everyone in the home is aware of the dangers of electricity and how it can kill.
