<p>Gently push the new, wired switch back into the electrical box and screw it in place. One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>

<p>Do not use water to extinguish an electrical fire. More than half of the 28,000 electrical home fires and nearly 70% of the 400 electrocutions that occur in the U.S. every year could have been prevented with two inexpensive, DIY-friendly safety devices: AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets. You should then be able to see if the wires are properly curled around the screws or if they are backstabbed.</p>
<p>Neglecting your home's electrical system can have devastating effects. All of the circuits to your home will be replaced to ensure that they are energy-compliant and that they won't be overloaded once the electricity is free-flowing again. But with most, you take the connector at the base of each light and slip it around the electrical wire until you hear a snap. If not, then the light switch will simply turn off the whole outlet, as well as the entire circuit following that outlet.</p>

We have highly trained and experienced electricians that can help you upgrade your electrical panel and keep your home protected.
