<p>Keep all appliance cords away from hot surfaces (toasters, range tops, ovens, etc.). Cords can be damaged by excessive heat. These 12V led lights will not get over heated or burn up like other incandescent or halogen bulb fixtures and will remain pretty cool outside ever after long hours of running since they produce a minimum amount of heat to the surroundings as well.

<p>Cut this wire so as to allow it to be connected to ANY breaker position in the panel - plus a little slack. Lutron and Touch-Plate offer upgraded systems that would allow you to continue to use your home's wiring, but would require new panels, relays, light switches, and other adaptations. Pigtail wires will require the use of silicone-filled wire nuts for connections. Seriously consider hiring an electrician who will allow you to do lots of the mundane work such as nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>
<p>The information you provide to us will be used to respond to requests you may make for services.

<p>The difference between a lighting installation and a thermostat or phone is the power consumption and possibility of overheating.
