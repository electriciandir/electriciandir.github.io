<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Crystal Lake</h2>
<p>There are a lot of causes for a power outage. Electric motors use more power to start than they do to run, which means electronic appliances with significant moving parts - such as fans, pumps, compressors on refrigerators, and air conditions - can use up to three times as more electricity to start as they do to run continuously. According to industry testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts and 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including surges from external sources not including lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system. Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
