Electric generation systems such as power plant equipment and hydroelectric energy are also managed by them. Older homes likely have outdated electrical outlets. Aluminum also has high electrical resistance, so it's difficult for current to flow through it. This means an aluminum wired home will have more electrical losses than one that's wired with copper.</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system. It is not aluminum and it is safe unless, as with any electrical wiring, it has been damaged in some manner. Most electricians learn on the job through an apprenticeship program of several years , which tends to vary by state.</p>
