Another residential technology that is seeing dramatic growth is solar power, which was the fastest growing electric source in the United States in 2011, according to recent findings by the Solar Electric Power Association.</p>

If you have a large property or a complex lighting design, the unusually long runs of wire to the transformer may lose voltage â called voltage dropâ â so a larger transformer is required to keep all lights on the same circuit. We were out of power at our old farmhouse for 13 days back in 2008, we borrowed a generator to run a few items in our office.</p>
<p>If you've gone through our home backup generator reviews and still want another fuel-economical generator, then this is your best bet. Electric generation systems such as power plant equipment and hydroelectric energy are also managed by them. Older homes likely have outdated electrical outlets. Aluminum also has high electrical resistance, so it's difficult for current to flow through it. This means an aluminum wired home will have more electrical losses than one that's wired with copper.</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system. It is not aluminum and it is safe unless, as with any electrical wiring, it has been damaged in some manner. Most electricians learn on the job through an apprenticeship program of several years , which tends to vary by state.</p>
