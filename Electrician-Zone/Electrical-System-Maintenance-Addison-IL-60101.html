When light fixtures flicker in such scenarios, you should quickly contact a trusted electrician and opt for a light repair service.</p>
<p>Most outdoor lighting systems use low voltage lighting which is employs 12 volts of electrical devices instead of the usual 120 volts that are used at home or in offices.
