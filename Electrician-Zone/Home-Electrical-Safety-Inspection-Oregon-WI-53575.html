Residential electrical contractors perform upgrades to home offices and home theaters.</p>

When power comes on again you can turn the switch off and disconnect the generator and return your setup to normal.

An automatic backup generator turns on within seconds of the power going out, and when the return of utility power is sensed, it automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode, ready for the next outage.</p>
<p>Construction electricians set up wiring systems to new constructions such as factories, businesses and homes. Smart light switches have more electronics packed into them and are bigger than their standard counterparts.
