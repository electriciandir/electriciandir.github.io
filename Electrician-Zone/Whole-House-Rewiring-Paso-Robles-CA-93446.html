The effectiveness of low voltage lighting systems have drastically improved over the years. Unless you are simply plugging in a surge protector to valuable electronics, or swapping a light bulb, opting for a licensed, professional electrician is in your best interest.</p>

<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them.
