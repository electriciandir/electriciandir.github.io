In a surge protector, the main power line (known as the hot wire or live wire) has an extra connection (a kind of "side road") linked to it that feeds to the ground wire (sometimes also called the Earth wire; the protective wire in an electric circuit that sends any unwanted current safely into the earth).</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to wear gloves and rubber soled shoes when working at the electrical panel, and to remove any jewelry.

<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
