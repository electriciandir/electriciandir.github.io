Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>

If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!).

You can double check to ensure that it was turned off by flipping the switch in an attempt to operate a light, and by using a voltage tester once the switch plate is removed to confirm that the wires are not charged. The existing electrical panel is in code violation and moving the panel is simply the easiest way to solve the problem.</p>
