<p>If you want to protect your electronic equipment from sudden damage or failure, then you may want to consider using a surge protector. You will need to bend or break off one of the new electrical box tabs in the back to run the wire through. Electrical contractors who do electrical work for the public, as opposed to electricians who work for electrical contractors, often need a special license.
