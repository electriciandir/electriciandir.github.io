<p>Some quick fixes like adapters, power strips and extension cords are fine to use in the short term, but come with safety hazards of their own. 600 Joules surge protection. This short in turn causes the circuit to use overflowing power, this extra power consumption then results in the breaker inside your electrical panel to trip shutting off the power to the circuit.
