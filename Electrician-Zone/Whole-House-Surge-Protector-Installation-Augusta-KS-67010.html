Portable generators can handle brief power outages; they are capable of powering your essential appliances during an outage. Because LEDs run on low power, back-up batteries for lighting systems can generate light for a longer time than a traditional system, or can provide more light from a smaller battery. Constant voltage will power LED arrays with a steady voltage regardless of current.</p>

Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
