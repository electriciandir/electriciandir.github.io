<p>The idea of a home energy audit is simple. The best fuel-efficient standby generator. Many people think of these power surges only occur during lightening storms. Before choosing a generator, particularly standby generators, you'll need to decide what equipment you want it to run. Whether you want an electrical panel upgrade or you need repair, we're ready to help. But for a permanent hard-wire installation, more precautions must be made to be Class 2 compliant.

Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets.

Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter.
