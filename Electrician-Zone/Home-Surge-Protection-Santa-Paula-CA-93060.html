<p>You might be working on a low-voltage application but live electrical circuits can still be pretty harmful especially when not used safely. Standby generators are sized by kilowatts (kW), which is a unit of power. Check the breaker that turns the circuit off; if it is a 20 amp breaker or fuse, you will need 12-3 wire (12 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground). A voltmeter would show power (to ground) without a neutral, while the disposal wouldn't run. You can purchase fixtures at Big box stores, hardware stores and lighting specialty stores.</p>

More than half of the 28,000 electrical home fires and nearly 70% of the 400 electrocutions that occur in the U.S. every year could have been prevented with two inexpensive, DIY-friendly safety devices: AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets.
