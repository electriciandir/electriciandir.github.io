Energy auditing, quality control, training and inspection services are available. Electricity can cause fires because of the heat that is generated. There are choices in outdoor lighting that homeowners can successfully install, but unless you are a certified and licensed electrician it is best to stick with solar lighting for doing it yourself. Uplighting is a landscape lighting technique that illuminates an area, surface or object from below to create a focal point in the landscape.</p>
<p>While only lasting for a few microseconds, lightning causes a dangerous voltage surge that can destroy your electronic devices. But lightning is by no means the major cause of power surges.
