<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source. If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
<p>Breakers that trip regularly, however, signal a larger issue like an overloaded circuit. Single-phase motors normally are limited to fractional horsepower ratings up to 5 horsepower. Place landscape lights—whether lanterns, torches, or floor lamps—carefully and thoughtfully, mindful to illuminate the areas of the outdoors that are the most visually arresting. Based on careful planning, scheduled group relamping involves calculating the average rated life and the average output of the lamps in your fixtures.</p>

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>
