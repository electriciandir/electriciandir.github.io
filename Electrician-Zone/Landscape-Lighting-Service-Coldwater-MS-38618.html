<p>There are two types of formal educational program for electricians, plus a required apprenticeship. Main Power Lines: This is the big main wire that will feed into the electrical panel. Draw the layout of the lights on paper, and take measurements outdoors to determine how much wire you'll need. Inspect extension cords for broken connectors, damaged insulation and missing hardware before each use. Outdoor low voltage lighting provide a pleasant alternative to glaring floodlights.</p>
