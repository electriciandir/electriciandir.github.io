<p>A Generac home backup generator provides electricity straight to your home, backing up your entire system or just the most vital household items. Furthermore, landscape lighting deters intruders by giving them less "shadows" in which to hide. When the city power goes out, the switch is what prevents the city power for coming into the house at the same time as the generator.
