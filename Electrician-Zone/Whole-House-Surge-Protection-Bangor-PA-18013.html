When checking continuity of a circuit, remember that the voltage on both sides of the closed contact should be the same. All of the outlets should use a three pin plug in order to have a grounded connection.

The difference between 2-prong and 3-pronged outlets is that the 3-pronged outlet has a ground.” Upgrading takes a little more work than just switching the outlet panel. If the lights dim whenever you use a particular outlet, you may be overloading the circuits or wiring. A licensed electrical contractor that is regularly employed by the school system and acting as an employee rather than a contractor while performing regular duties for the school system is not subjected to the examination process and shall be certified as a school maintenance electrician by the NC Department of Insurance upon properly executing and submitting the application for approval.</p>

Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician. The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation.
