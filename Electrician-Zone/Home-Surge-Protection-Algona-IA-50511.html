Moisture penetrates the plastic connectors and corrodes the wires and cause a poor connection or worst, high resistance in the wires causing the transformer to overheat and eventually burn out the transformer. If you want to learn to be a residential electrician, you will need a high school diploma or a G.E.D. It's helpful to take math, science and shop classes in high school.
