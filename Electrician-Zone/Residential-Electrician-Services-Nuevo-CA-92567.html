The generator turns on when your utility power is disrupted, and then shuts off and re-enters standby mode as soon as your utility power is restored. Instead, what one should see is the landscape itself and not the lights so that the outdoor lighting can tell a visual story at night.</p>
<p>So for instance, if you enter your kitchen from one space and there is a switch there and you come in from the other side and there is another switch there, both of those switches control the same light, that's a three-way switch.
