<p>These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4.

The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home.
