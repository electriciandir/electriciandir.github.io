<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home. For example, when an outlet is not working, they may use a multimeter to check the voltage, amperage, or resistance to determine the best course of action. Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter.

<p>Halogen lights might appeal to you initially since their starting price points are lower than LED fixtures. For example, most cable shipped with low-voltage lighting systems is 16 through 12 AWG (American Wire Gauge), depending upon the anticipated load of each circuit and the size of the power supply.
