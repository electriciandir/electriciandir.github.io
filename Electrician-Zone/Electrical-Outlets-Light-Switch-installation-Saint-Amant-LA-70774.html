<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>
<p>Whether you are considering the use of patio lights, deck lights, lamp posts, or other types of solar yard lights, you will find that the possibilities are endless.

Quality standby generators will shut down if they lose oil pressure, overheat, or are being worked too hard. LED lights can be installed in practically any location and programmed to emit colors that homeowners prefer. Your circuit breakers frequently trip.
