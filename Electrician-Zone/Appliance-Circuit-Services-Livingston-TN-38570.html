<p>Lighting repairs are an important part of the look and feel of a St. Louis home. Banks Electric highly recommends upgradeing the electrical panel if your home has one of these panels installed.

<p>As homes grow in their dependence on electricity with the addition of rooms, appliances large and small, and entertainment and computer equipment, electrical systems designed to handle lower electrical demands expected at an earlier point in time can be-come overburdened and problems can develop. Our heavy duty commercial grade Led String Lights are designed for indoor and outdoor use and can withstand extreme hot or cold temperatures. They protect systems and equipment from the effects of excessive current, and they provide a way to switch power on and off and isolate circuits or equipment on which work is being performed.</p>
<p>But, I was doing this prior to LED lighting, and the amperages were higher so it made the VD more significant than you would have with LED lighting.
