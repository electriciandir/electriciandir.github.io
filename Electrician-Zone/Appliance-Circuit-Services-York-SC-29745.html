<p>I clearly remember years ago when the ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) breaker was introduced into the code. If that total is close to the value of the transformer's capacity, purchase a low-voltage transformer one size larger.

Lights should be installed by an electrician in most circumstances in the home and also in commercial properties.</p>
