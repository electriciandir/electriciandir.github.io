<p>After completing this course, participants should know the characteristics and basic operation of a typical battery system and its components. But it's important to not overdo outdoor lighting, whether it's LED landscape lighting, lanterns, or even outdoor floor lamps. Use the proper electrical cord for the job, and put safety plugs in unused outlets.

<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>The cost of a generator is roughly equivalent to the amount of power it puts out, so in order to get the best value it is important to start by assessing how much power you will actually need. Our outdoor LED lamps use a fraction of the amount of energy consumed by halogen or incandescent light bulbs, and won't need to be replaced for at least 5 years.

LED lamps are ideal for exterior landscape lighting designs since these can be modified and be set up with a low voltage setup.</p>
