Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>
<p>Trends like this aren't surprising, given that during Hurricane Sandy three in four people in the Connecticut, New Jersey and New York areas lost power from their utility company for at least one day, with a median of seven days of power loss, according to a survey from the Consumer Reports National Research Center People see that one house on their street that had power throughout the storm, and they want a generator,” says Dan Giampetroni, a business manager at Kohler.</p>

If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4. Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
