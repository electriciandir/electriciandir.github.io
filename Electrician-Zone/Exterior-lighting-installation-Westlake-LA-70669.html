<p>These indoor units are manufactured with secondary input connections that are compatible with wiring methods from NEC chapter 3, such as those that include ½ inch knockouts or NM cable clamp, permitting compliance with 411.4. Section 411.4 states that low-voltage lighting systems must not be concealed or the wiring must not extend through a building wall, unless using a wiring method specified in chapter 3. The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
