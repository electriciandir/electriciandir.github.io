<p>It's also very convenient since you wouldn't have to worry so much about refueling, thus you're saving from high costs of using natural gas or diesels. The utility professionals who work near overhead power lines must wear appropriate safety clothing, use tested safety equipment, and take training to be able to do the installation, maintenance, and repair work they do.
