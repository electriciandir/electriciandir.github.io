After tapping the lights into the wiring, strip the ends of the low-voltage power cable, and connect them to the terminals on the transformer.

There are many things to take into consideration when installing an electrical panel and the On Time Electrical team will make sure they address them all.

The use of 12 or 10-gauge main cable increases efficiency and allows you to either place greater loads on your home runs or to use a lower voltage tap, in effect giving you the ability to increase voltage to existing fixtures in the future or to add more fixtures to that run without having to install a new home run cable. When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
