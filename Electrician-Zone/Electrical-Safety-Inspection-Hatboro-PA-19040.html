To work as a licensed electrician you need to get approval from the Delaware Division of Professional Regulation.</p>

Often electricians work independently on projects, but they may also be part of a larger construction team.</p>

Call (800) 906-4577 for qualified emergency electricians as soon as possible.</p>

We offer Design and Electrical Services with latest technology for LV & HV panels, tailor made to suit customer requirements.
