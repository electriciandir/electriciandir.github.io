<p>Lightning strokes, which amount to 200 kA or 300 kV, cause hazards to the equipment or location, so lightning protection is crucial for operation.

Time - Your electrician's time is usually the most expensive component of any bill. This would really help me avoid electrical fires or overloading a circuit. The unit is heavy and the installation is costly. The generator package comes with an automatic transfer switch that can handle quick and seamless transfer during a power outage with computer-controlled load management.</p>
