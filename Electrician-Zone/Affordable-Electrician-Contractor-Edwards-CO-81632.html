You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>

You should also be on the lookout for any unusual smells, sounds, or electrical malfunctions as they could also indicate looming electric panel problems. How many circuits there are, as well as their sizes, decides how that power is distributed throughout your home. Sometimes this problem can go unnoticed, because the circuit breakers don't trip even if they are overloaded.</p>

You would require experience in onsite electrical wiring, switchboards, motors etc. The really good news is that there is absolutely no wiring at all in solar outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch. If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
