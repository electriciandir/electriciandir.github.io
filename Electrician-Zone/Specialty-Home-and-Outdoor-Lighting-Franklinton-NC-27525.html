Electrical surge protectors are available in many optional model formats, to protect a single device, such as a computer, to strips of outlets so you can plug in your whole entertainment system.

<h3>Principles of Lightning and Surge Protection in Franklinton NC</h3>

<p>There is a problem if the voltage climbs above 120 volts, and a surge protector assists to keep that problem from destroying your computer or any other sensitive electric equipments. Maintenance can be performed by skilled installers rather than licensed electricians, whereas for traditional lighting systems a trained electrician is the safe choice. A home inspector might even point out that it is because of knob and tube wiring without an electrician's proper metering equipment and the ability to use it correctly, you will not know for sure.</p>
