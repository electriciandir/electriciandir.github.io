They are superior in giving power to universal motors, like those that can be seen in some power tools.</p>
<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
