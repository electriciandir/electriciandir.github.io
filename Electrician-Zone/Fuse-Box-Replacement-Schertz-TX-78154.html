Standby generators are sized by kilowatts (kW), which is a unit of power. Check the breaker that turns the circuit off; if it is a 20 amp breaker or fuse, you will need 12-3 wire (12 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground). A voltmeter would show power (to ground) without a neutral, while the disposal wouldn't run. You can purchase fixtures at Big box stores, hardware stores and lighting specialty stores.</p>

A licensed electrical technician can determine whether the wirings are no longer safe to use and if so, he can make the necessary replacements.</p>
<p>Also if power supply transformers are used to reduce the voltage, then they also isolate the low voltage system from the mains voltage which increases safety.
