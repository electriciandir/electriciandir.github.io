Your home and safety are too important to use a non licensed electrician. You pay a substantial price for the convenience of a permanently installed generator, and that price increases substantially as output goes up. It starts at about $3,000 for the 6- to 8-kw models and reaches from $5,000 to $10,000 for the 11- to 20-kw units. The variety of light fixtures and lighting accessories has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>Make sure all 3-wired tools and appliances with flexible cords are properly grounded. There are some wiring systems out there that are actually better at conducting and are more efficient like fiber optics, but because of its wide availability copper wire still remains king.

Within seconds your transfer switch will detect a power outage and automatically kick on your generator power without you lifting a finger.
