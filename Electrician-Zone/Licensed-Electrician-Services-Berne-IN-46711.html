<p>I'm not sure if you're aware of the fact that inside your home are a lot of sensitive electronics. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC. An electrician working on a commercial or industrial building must be able to correctly size loads.</p>

Check the breaker that turns the circuit off; if it is a 20 amp breaker or fuse, you will need 12-3 wire (12 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground). A voltmeter would show power (to ground) without a neutral, while the disposal wouldn't run. You can purchase fixtures at Big box stores, hardware stores and lighting specialty stores.</p>
