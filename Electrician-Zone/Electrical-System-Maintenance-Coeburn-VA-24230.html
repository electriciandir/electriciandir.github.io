<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed.
