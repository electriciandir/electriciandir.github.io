<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>
<p>If you wanted to control the two lights separately from two different switches in the same box, a three conductor cable with ground would need to be installed to the first light instead of a two conductor cable.
