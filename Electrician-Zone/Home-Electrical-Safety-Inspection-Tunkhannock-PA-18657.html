<p>Ag-Pro Companies is the Premiere Plus Dealer of Generac Generators. TIP: It is a good practice to wrap the outlet terminals with electrical tape to prevent them from making contact with other wires or the electrical box itself if it is metal. Before going to sleep or heading out, make it a habit of confirming that all electrical appliances, such as game consoles, TVs and kitchen appliances, that are not in use are properly turned off. One increasingly popular option is to purchase a standby generator , also known as a whole-house generator.</p>
<p>For example, a residential electrician who has not been in business for very long may offer a discount for homeowners who can give referrals. DON'T yank an electrical cord from the wall.

By definition, this means that the traditional electricity partners of SMBs, the electrical contractors, are poised to face disruption as the demand for energy consumption reduction, maintenance and monitoring goes up due to a variety of reasons. High quality electrical contractors invest in ongoing training to further hone and perfect their expert skills.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
