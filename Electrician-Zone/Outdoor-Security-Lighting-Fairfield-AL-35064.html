Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity.

Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>

Heavy covering of wires can cause the cords to overheat, which could lead to an electrical fire. Done right, landscape lighting makes the best of what you've got by highlighting your home's architectural features and drawing attention to prized plantings and trees.

<p>Unfortunately, you do not have the wire necessary in the box to make a half hot - the permanent hot is missing and only the switched hot is available. True Power Technology is also a key highlight like with many other Generac generators, and it delivers top-notch power with less than 5% THD to run sensitive appliances and electronics safely and smoothly.

An electrician apprenticeship program for candidates working toward a journeyman electrician license typically lasts 3 to 5 years.

The use of 12 or 10-gauge main cable increases efficiency and allows you to either place greater loads on your home runs or to use a lower voltage tap, in effect giving you the ability to increase voltage to existing fixtures in the future or to add more fixtures to that run without having to install a new home run cable. When a surge protective device senses a transient voltage spike, it uses internal components called Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) that act like magnets for the excess voltage, and sends it to the load center's ground wire before it can reach your home's connected electronics.</p>
<p>It'll cost a little bit more to set up, but you don't have to worry about running out of fuel for the most part. Carefully put the wires back in the wall box. It can be tricky to fully charge solar lights, especially if you live in an area where it is frequently cloudy or rainy.
