In fact, many computer users agree that Belkin surge protectors provide the same, if not better, protection as other surge protectors at only a fraction of the prices of their competitors. The three wires in a standard NMB cable are connected to the three prongs in a standard electrical outlet The neutral and hot wires are connected to the two vertical prongs at the top of the receptacle, with neutral on the left silver screw and hot on the right gold screw, and the ground wire is connected to the green screw at the bottom.</p>

If a property is experiencing flickering lights, frequently blown circuits, or malfunctioning outlets, the electrical panel may need be inspected, especially if it is determined there are no wiring issues or issues with electrical appliances.
