Emergency power restoration and repair services are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Our tamper resistant receptacles improve the safety points of your electrical outlets. Models are even available that are installed in your electrical panel breaker box to protect your entire home electrical system and therefore all of the electronics you have plugged in.</p>
<p>Diesel is a popular choice of fuel for larger, commercial generators. They can often take far more than what they are rated to handle and have been the staple of power protection for years. Let us start with the initial note as to what is lightning and why lightning protection is so important. Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
