Excess current could have been caused by: overload on the load; short circuit between the wires, grounded wires, short circuit in the load, ground in the load, voltage spike, voltage droop, etc.</p>
<p>While only lasting for a few microseconds, lightning causes a dangerous voltage surge that can destroy your electronic devices. But lightning is by no means the major cause of power surges.
