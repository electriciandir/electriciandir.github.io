NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
<p>This type of lighting can drastically reduce the amount of voltage the lighting uses, so it causes less of a drain on your property's energy and your wallet. Though they work automatically, circuit breakers occasionally fail by neglecting to stop flow in the event of a dangerous situation.
