When the city power goes out, the switch is what prevents the city power for coming into the house at the same time as the generator.

<h3>The Importance of Lightning Surge Protection in Red Springs NC</h3>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>However, there are local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check with your local jurisdiction before you start work. Home standby generators are installed permanently, can run on natural gas or propane, and kick on automatically during an outage. We use a pole lighting bucket truck to reach tall outdoor lights and electrical systems so we can more effectively make a diagnosis and repairs. When the generator is engaged, it will consume fuel (gas or propane) to provide electrical power to your home.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks. We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>

Note where the white (neutral), black (power), and green or bare copper (ground) wires are attached on the existing outlet.
