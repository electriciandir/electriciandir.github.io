<p>Although single motors and single controllers are sometimes used in isolated applications, the more usual application is one in which many motors and many controllers are interlinked into a larger automated system that includes many types of processes. For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it.

<p>It is quite basic to turn off the electric circuit even when simply replacing bulbs so electric shock can be avoided. We can perform rewiring, allowing you to article off your lighting so you only use it where you need it when you need it. In a surge protector, the main power line (known as the hot wire or live wire) has an extra connection (a kind of "side road") linked to it that feeds to the ground wire (sometimes also called the Earth wire; the protective wire in an electric circuit that sends any unwanted current safely into the earth).</p>
