One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
<p>Or when you turned it on, it could have added too much of a load to what's already turned on. In that case, consider having an electrical repairman install a new circuit breaker with a higher rating.

<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians.
