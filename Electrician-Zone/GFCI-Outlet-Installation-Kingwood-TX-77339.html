<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician Contractor in Kingwood</h2>

<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>
<p>Standby generators can be expensive but many homeowners living in hurricane or flood-prone areas, find that they are a smart investment.

That's why a lot of employers recommend getting some basic electrical training before applying for the apprenticeships that they sponsor.
