<p>Electronics are expensive these days. Any burglars will easily be discouraged to enter a well-lit home or business when exterior lights are in place as compared to any house which is barely illuminated or dark.

On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years. An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians.</p>
