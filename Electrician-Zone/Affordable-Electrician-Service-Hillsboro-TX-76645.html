<p>A surge protector removes the threat of your home catching on fire because of too much power supply. Start by running the wires from the light assembly through the riser base and attach the stake.

On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years. An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians.</p>
