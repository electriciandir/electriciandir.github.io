<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>
