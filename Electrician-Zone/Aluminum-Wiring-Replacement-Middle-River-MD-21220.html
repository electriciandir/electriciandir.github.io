The Boerne, TX commercial electricians at D'Spain Sales and Service offer quality commercial lighting services throughout the Texas Hill Country area. Older homes, mostly homes built prior to 1970, are at risk for electrical fires. Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs.
