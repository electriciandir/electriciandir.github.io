TIP: It is a good practice to wrap the outlet terminals with electrical tape to prevent them from making contact with other wires or the electrical box itself if it is metal. Before going to sleep or heading out, make it a habit of confirming that all electrical appliances, such as game consoles, TVs and kitchen appliances, that are not in use are properly turned off.
