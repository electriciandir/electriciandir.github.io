The way your home is wired, the distribution of electricity to various electronics, and the quality of work delivered by a licensed electrician can be the literal death or life of your home and your family. Any applicant is obliged to pass business law and electrical contractor exam. In a 12 VAC circuit the voltage drop from the low voltage lighting transformer, that is converting or stepping down the 120 VAC to 12 VAC to the light fixtures can have a major impact on the quality and level of light that you and your guests will see.</p>

<p>We offer panel repair and replacement, panel cover replacement, breaker replacement and inspections. Turn it on and, if you have done everything correctly, you should see the fixtures light up. If problems do occur, think to check that the light bulbs are inserted correctly and working before assuming you have a faulty transformer.
