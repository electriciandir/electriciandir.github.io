<p>A surge protector removes the threat of your home catching on fire because of too much power supply. Start by running the wires from the light assembly through the riser base and attach the stake. Do the same with the black wires. Even if you are not noticing any signs of failure or overload, but you know that your electrical panel is a few decades old, it may be time to replace it. On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years. An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians.</p>
<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock. Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician.
