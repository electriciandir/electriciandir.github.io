The front of the house isn't the only place to use landscape lights. Outlets will need to meet or exceed your local electrical codes to ensure the safety of your home and family. Due to these requirements, 120v systems are relatively permanent once they are installed. This can save you money by turning off the pathway lighting or special art enhancing spotlights after certain hours of the night.</p>

An electrical upgrade by Mr. Electric will ensure that you are getting the most out of your home's electrical system.

Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
