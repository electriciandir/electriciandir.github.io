<p>Electrical box problems can potentially be quite dangerous, so it is very important to identify and repair any issues that develop. In this situation, the contactor does not appear to be operating and an electrical failure is suspected in the power circuit. Lighting only the house can look unnatural — even bleak — but uplit trees and statuary add depth and softness.

Generator repair is just as important as initial installation. These minor surges might occur from things like fan motors or other large power drain devices turning on and off frequently. These numbers don't even factor in the more than $800 million in property loses annually linked to electrical fires and other related issues.</p>
