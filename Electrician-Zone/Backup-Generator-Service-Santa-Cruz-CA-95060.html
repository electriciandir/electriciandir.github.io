Whether you need one technician or an entire team of electrical specialist, all of our staff is courteous and well trained. You can be fined $22,000 as an individual or $110,000 as a company for doing unlicensed electrical work. A training licence is valid for the period of apprenticeship or traineeship. Determining the height in which you would like the light to be installed will help to narrow down the choice as well as the overall design of the home.

Amazingly, most solar lights are able to last a very long time on the light they receive from the sun each day.
