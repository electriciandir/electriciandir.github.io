<p>A common misunderstanding is that the ampacity (size, or capacity) of a home's electrical service is determined by checking the main breaker or fuses or the rating imprinted on the panel. Consider matching your modern home décor with some contemporary lighting fixtures that feature simple geometric forms and chic, industrial finishes. Leave the hot wire extra long and fold it back and forth across the bottom of the box.
