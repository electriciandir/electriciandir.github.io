<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Contractor in Glen Ellyn</h2>
<p>I'm not sure if you're aware of the fact that inside your home are a lot of sensitive electronics. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC. An electrician working on a commercial or industrial building must be able to correctly size loads.</p>

In a direct lightning strike on a building with no protection, a voltage spike can enter your home through the switchboard and destroy all your electronic equipment.</p>
<h2>Home Electrical Improvements Glen Ellyn Illinois</h2>
<p>A surge protector works by redirecting the surge to the ground away from any equipment that you have plugged into it.

Refrain from using extension cords in wet areas unless intentionally designed for such use. The answer is to schedule regular maintenance visits with your service provider.</p>
