<p>Never put objects into electrical outlets.

A wall-mounted remote looks like a normal switch but lets you adjust both fan speed and light level without rewiring.</p>
<p>Even though Tables 11(A) and 11(B) in chapter 9 apply to Class 2 and Class 3 power supplies and not specifically to low-voltage lighting systems, these tables can provide direction and information for acceptable ac and dc voltage levels for both dry and wet locations.
