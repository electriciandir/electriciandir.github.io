Breaker and fuse box panels are complicated and delicate pieces of equipment. Some prefer to have slightly brighter lights that allow them to see their entire yard, this gives them a sense of security; others prefer a much more subdued light that creates an ambience rather than a light show.

<p>Two or three wires will be attached to the switch: an incoming hot wire, which is black; a return wire, which carries the load to the fixture and may be black, red, or any other color except green; and sometimes a grounding wire , which is green or bare copper. It is recommended that you turn off your home's main circuit breaker until you determine the source of the smoke while you wait on an electrician to arrive.
