<p>Most standby generators are big. Electrical panels installed after 2000 are quite safe and reliable. On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present.

<p>Over time, however, panels can age, and their components wear out, which will necessitate repairs. You will also need a firm understanding of Ohms law (Volt x Amps = Watts) and how it works in relation to laying out the wiring for the lighting system.
