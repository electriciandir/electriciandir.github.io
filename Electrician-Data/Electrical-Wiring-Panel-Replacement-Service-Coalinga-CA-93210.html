Never touch the bus bar inside an electrical service panel unless the main breaker has been turned off or the main fuse removed. One of the dangers of PVC wiring is that if there are a lot of wires confined in a small area, this may lead the wires to overheat.</p>

If not, then the light switch will simply turn off the whole outlet, as well as the entire circuit following that outlet.</p>
<p>Low-voltage cable is commonly available in 12-, 14-, and 16-gauge.
