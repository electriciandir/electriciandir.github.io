On complex circuits, time generally does not allow the troubleshooter to study the complete circuit in-depth to determine how it operates. As mentioned, local ordinances on house electrical wire tend to be more strict than national codes. Keep in mind though that the use of safety switches doesn't mean you can be less careful when using electricity - they are no substitute for proper electrical maintenance and safe practices.</p>
