<p>Most people know that surge suppression protects sensitive electronics, but they would struggle to explain why it's necessary. Two great experiences in a row with TLC - great service and quick resolutions to our issues. For controlling the low-voltage-operated switching relays that in turn operate 120V devices in buildings (lights, receptacles), very thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls. There's no way to know how much protection a device has left, or if the initial rating is even accurate. We purchased a Generac full house generator from Kegley Electric.</p>

Fuel consumption varies depending upon the horsepower rating of the generator's engine.</p>
<p>And it can even make your landscape more dramatic, with well-placed outdoor spotlights and washes casting intriguing shadows and highlighting the best plants, water features with underwater lights and other aspects.
