However, the basic three of them are the NM, NMC and UF electrical wires.</p>
<p>When there's only one cable entering an outlet box, it means the outlet is the last fixture on the circuit. You can also substitute up to 1 year of work experience for completion of a 2-year, post-high school course in electrical technology and passing an exam.
