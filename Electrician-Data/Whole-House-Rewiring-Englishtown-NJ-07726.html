<p>Most people know that surge suppression protects sensitive electronics, but they would struggle to explain why it's necessary. Two great experiences in a row with TLC - great service and quick resolutions to our issues. For controlling the low-voltage-operated switching relays that in turn operate 120V devices in buildings (lights, receptacles), very thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls.

The utility professionals who work near overhead power lines must wear appropriate safety clothing, use tested safety equipment, and take training to be able to do the installation, maintenance, and repair work they do. It is vital that safety equipment is regularly tested as even non-conductive materials, such as rubber, wood, or plastic, can conduct electricity if damp, dirty, or damaged.</p>
