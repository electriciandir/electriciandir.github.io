<p>Whole house surge protector helps ward your entire house against high outdoor power surges. We created this electrical safety checklist for your safety and peace of mind, but it's no substitute for an annual electrical inspection by an electrician.

Emergencies can happen at any time of the day, and when you need an urgent repair for your egress lighting, your safety and your occupants' safety shouldn't be left on hold.</p>

The National Fire Protection Association's report on home electrical fires shows that electrical failures and malfunctions are now the biggest contributors to the start of a home fire.</p>
<p>Today's homes require up to 200 amps of power or more. You might decide to go with a reputable company that has a history with standby generator system installation If you have no company in mind, then go with a referral.
