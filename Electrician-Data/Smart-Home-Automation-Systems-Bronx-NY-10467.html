If you pull out that switch and you see there are three wires going to it, you will want to disconnect those three wires and keep in mind two of those wires are going to be the same color and one will be a different color.</p>
<p>When the white is connected, the breaker won't set. The dimmer switch may have three wires to connect the power and ground rather than terminal screws.
