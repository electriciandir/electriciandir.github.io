Check the breaker that turns the circuit off; if it is a 20 amp breaker or fuse, you will need 12-3 wire (12 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground). A voltmeter would show power (to ground) without a neutral, while the disposal wouldn't run. You can purchase fixtures at Big box stores, hardware stores and lighting specialty stores.</p>

<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home.
