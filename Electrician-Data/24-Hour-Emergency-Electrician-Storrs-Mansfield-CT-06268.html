We believe that electric service, while a dramatically changing industry, is rooted in two historical principals - always strive to reduce cost, and always offer the most continuous, highest quality power possible.</p>
<p>But there are a few things that electricians will not do. Most portable units run on gas or propane. Sizzling noises in the switch means that it is time to have it looked at. It may be a faulty or an old switch in which case it will need replacing or it could just be that the wires or terminals have become loose in which case it is just a matter of tightening the screws. Standby generators should be started up once a week and run for 15 minutes to "exercise" them - making sure they're ready when needed.</p>
