A home generator plus installation typically starts under $6,000.

Home standby generators are installed permanently, can run on natural gas or propane, and kick on automatically during an outage.

When the generator is engaged, it will consume fuel (gas or propane) to provide electrical power to your home.</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system. It is not aluminum and it is safe unless, as with any electrical wiring, it has been damaged in some manner. Most electricians learn on the job through an apprenticeship program of several years , which tends to vary by state.</p>
<p>A professional landscape lighting installation is as important as good design. Note where the white (neutral), black (power), and green or bare copper (ground) wires are attached on the existing outlet. Step 3: Unplug all of the appliances on the circuit whose breaker keeps tripping. Unexpected power failures, blown fuses or damaged electrical equipment could all be electrical emergencies. It is also noisy, emits harmful carbon monoxide and the engine wears faster than diesel, propane or natural gas generators.</p>
