Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>

Our commercial electricians can provide light pole maintenance to keep your lights burning brightly (and safely) every night night after night.
