<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch. If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
<p>Electrical installing work must be carried out by a licensed electrical contractor, who in turn must employ licensed electricians.

Maintenance can be performed by skilled installers rather than licensed electricians, whereas for traditional lighting systems a trained electrician is the safe choice. A home inspector might even point out that it is because of knob and tube wiring without an electrician's proper metering equipment and the ability to use it correctly, you will not know for sure.</p>
