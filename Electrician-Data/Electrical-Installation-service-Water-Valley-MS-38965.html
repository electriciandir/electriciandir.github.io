Portable generators tend to be smaller and less expensive than standby generators. General Journey Level Electrician - You must have 8,000 hours of experience working as an electrical trainee under the supervision of a certified electrician.</p>
<p>Also, consider that a circuit breaker panel upgrade will likely require an electrical permit and inspection. I bought two for my massive landscape lighting project.
