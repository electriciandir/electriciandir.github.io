Most landscape lighting requires relatively low wattage, so you don't need the extra voltage anyway. Many switches and receptacles have holes in the back of the device's body for making "stab-in" connections. Knob and tube upgrades - Knob and tube electrical systems are common in older homes. For example, in Florida, electrical contractors may be locally registered (by filing evidence of a current occupational license and compliance with local examination and licensing requirements) or state certified (by taking and passing the state licensing examination).</p>
