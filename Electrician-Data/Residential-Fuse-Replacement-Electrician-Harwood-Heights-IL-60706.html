<p>While electronics are becoming almost indispensable to our daily lives they are vulnerable to power surges. Turn off electrical appliances when they're not in use; always attend to them when they're on. Backup generators can vary in size from portable to large. Or you can show proof that you've obtained at least 8,000 hours of apprenticeship training. If you live in an older house, the wires appear black and white. Standby generators can add value to your home and safeguard your family by keeping power running in an emergency, but this always-on protection is expensive.
