If the switch is grounded, remove the grounding wire last.</p>
<p>Surge protectors more commonly protect equipment from lower-voltage surges that occur frequently in modern electrical wiring. The total amperage of the branch circuit breakers serving the house should not exceed the amperage of the panel.
