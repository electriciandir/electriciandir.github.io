Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.

<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems.

We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>

Other panels experiencing problems just need a little routine maintenance (tightening connections and updating components) to bring them back to peak performance.
