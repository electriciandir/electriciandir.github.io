As electricians do not need a degree, their experience is more important than their education levels.</p>
<p>Concern for safety - Electricians work in dangerous environments which place them at risk of shocks and burns, so it's important to be cautious. The method of replacing a double pole switch is exactly the same as the single pole with the exception that there will be more wires in the back box and connected to the switch. Employment services hire 2 percent of electricians. Twenty-four percent of electricians have at least 20 years of experience, 22 percent have between one and four years of experience, and 21 percent have between five and nine years of experience.</p>
