<p>Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry. The proliferation of wireless handheld devices that charge at lower voltages make surge protection more important than ever.

So, lets say it cost $10 a day to fuel just 1 generator, that is $50 a day for 7 days, that is about $350 for the week, not including at lease $700 per generator, which is around $3500 for the generators.</p>
