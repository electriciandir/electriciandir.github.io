Sounds like all the outlets and lights are being fed from the one switch, but only some were actually using it. Take the two wires that attached to the same timer wire, and splice them together with a wire nut, along with a new 6" piece of wire. Type 1 devices are installed at the utility meter, Type 2 devices are mounted to the load side of the main service panel and Type 3 devices are typically plugged into electronic equipment within the home.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring. If an electrical ground is not located in the motor starter overload circuit, the problem has been isolated to the control circuit field wiring. If you've already purchased your standby generator , we can still perform a premium installation for your peace of mind.
