<p>To understand how this works, one must understand how an electrical circuit works. Older homes can have serious hidden hazards that require inspection and repair by electrical experts. This isn't a successful way to sell landscape lighting and typically leads to a less than stellar end result. Even if everything is working properly, it's always good to have a licensed electrician like ElectriCall come troubleshoot and label your panel switches.

The braided fabric wire insulation was found on a 1960's fluorescent light ballast, while the plastic wire was used in the branch circuit wiring for the light where that ballast was employed. These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>
