The blaze began in the home's attic due to the incorrectly installed electrical wiring in the home and the smolder began in the insulation. Set all the light fixtures back into position, checking to make sure they're equally spaced.

When power comes on again you can turn the switch off and disconnect the generator and return your setup to normal.
