<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Graniteville</h2>
<p>There are a lot of causes for a power outage. Electric motors use more power to start than they do to run, which means electronic appliances with significant moving parts - such as fans, pumps, compressors on refrigerators, and air conditions - can use up to three times as more electricity to start as they do to run continuously. According to industry testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts and 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including surges from external sources not including lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Given all this, it's no wonder that you're thinking about installing landscape lighting, although you're also likely very curious about how much such an installation is going to set you back. If another outlet is connected through the outlet, an outgoing black wire may be connected to the second brass terminal and the white outgoing wire should be connected to the other nickel colored terminal.
