<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Harlem</h2>
<p>Electricians need the right tools and equipment to perform their job easily and properly. A boiler feed pump being powered by two 3500 hp induction motors appears to be developing a problem. In single-family residences, the owner of the building owns the electric service panel, not the electric company. Dream Team Home Services is your home's ultimate team. Remove about 12 in. of the white outer plastic sheathing from the cable before you push it into the box (Photo 7). Use a stripping tool like ours for 12-2 and 14-2 cable, or an inexpensive ($2.50) sheathing stripper that works on all cables.</p>
<p>Upgrading your electric panel ensures that all of your new appliances are supported and that your family and home are safe from any dangers that might occur from overloading your system. Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
