<p>Simulations are a realistic yet completely safe way to learn a high-risk skill, such as troubleshooting electrical systems. A common electrical upgrade involves installing ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) on receptacles and arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) on breakers. New houses typically come and a 200-amp service and an electrical panel that is suitable for handling the load of modern appliances. It's not a wise decision to rely on the light you get from your neighbors or street lights when strolling through your yard.</p>
<p>Replacing the main circuit breaker costs between $40 to $100 for the part and another $40 to $100 per hour to have an electrician install it. The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.
