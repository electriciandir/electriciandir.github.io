As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>

I'd give serious consideration to hiring an electrician that will allow you to do lots of the mundane work like nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all of the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>

Such a system could run that same 3,000-square-foot house with about 20kW, cutting power to nonessential circuits as necessary. Maybe the solution is to put a box in the basement ceiling to feed the lights, but I don't know if that's an option. Depending on the age of your home and its current wiring system, it may be time to upgrade from a fuse box to a breaker box to avoid damage to your home or electrical equipment.</p>
