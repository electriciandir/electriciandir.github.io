<p>A single lightning strike or other power spiking occurrences that could disrupt the power structure near or in your area can cause damage to expensive appliances. Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value. As skilled tradesmen that perform highly specialized and potentially dangerous work, electricians are subject to strict licensing requirements that must be met to legally practice their craft.</p>
