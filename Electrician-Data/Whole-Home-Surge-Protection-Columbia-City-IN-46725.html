It's usually a small unit and has only one voltage available, so you will have some effect from "voltage drop" - a kind of line loss that occurs from fixture to fixture or over any amount of wire distance. Here are some tips that will go a long way in helping you avoid some common problems with backup generators.

<p>Choose quality surge protection strips for inside your home.
