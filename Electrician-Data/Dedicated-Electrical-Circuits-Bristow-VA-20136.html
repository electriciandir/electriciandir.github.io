Well lights are light fixtures (that can be low voltage) which can be buried in the ground and lie concealed and up light any surrounding landscape, architecture, and lights create the illusory effect of light spewing from the earth itself.

<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing.
