<p>Without a fully operational electrical panel, your electrical system as a whole will experience issues. Well lights are light fixtures (that can be low voltage) which can be buried in the ground and lie concealed and up light any surrounding landscape, architecture, and lights create the illusory effect of light spewing from the earth itself. Water conducts electricity, so the fire could actually ignite further. We know that people do business with companies that meet their needs and provide reliable service.</p>

You will, of course, need an already existing outlet that is half switched or will need to add a switch yourself. Neatly fold the wires into the box in this order: grounds, neutrals and then hots.
