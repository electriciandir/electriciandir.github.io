<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in East Brunswick</h2>
<p>Whole-house backup generators from BGE HOME will keep the lights on when the power goes out. Journeymen electricians work with mechanical connections, lighting installation, power supplies, security systems and communications in both residences and commercial buildings.

<p>You could have faulty wiring, old circuits, and outdated panel or improperly electrical wiring behind your walls. Our highly trained and experienced electricians undergo continuous education to stay on top of the changing world of technology. Test both the power source and new outlets with an outlet tester, volt meter, or small portable electronic device.

<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>
