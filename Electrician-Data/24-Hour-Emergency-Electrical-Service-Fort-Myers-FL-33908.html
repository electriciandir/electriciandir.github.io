<p>11 18 19 The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology.

If the outlet is already switched, but the tab is not broken, it means that both halves are switched.

<p>While a spa, hot tub, or sauna sounds like a delightfully hedonistic addition to your home, all these luxury accessories involve both water and electricity, which means that improper installations can lead to disastrous results.

<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets. Low voltage systems run on voltages lower than 30 volts DC (usually 12 or 24 volts) and use a 'Class 2' power source. Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments. Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>
