Older homes, mostly homes built prior to 1970, are at risk for electrical fires. Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs. We make sure that your outdoor lighting system is good as new, by conducting frequent outdoor lighting inspections and repairs, and by making sure that fixtures and glass lenses are clean.</p>
<p>Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry. The proliferation of wireless handheld devices that charge at lower voltages make surge protection more important than ever. Enclosure - Because standby generators usually are installed outdoors, they need to be made of a hardwearing material that can bear up to harsh weather, environmental damage, and many years of use. The National Electrical Code (NEC) requires outlets reachable by children have an interior shield that prevents the insertion of foreign objects like paper clips or coins, preventing shocks.</p>
<p>Install ground fault circuit interrupter outlets in potentially hazardous areas such as near pools, crawl spaces, kitchens, bathrooms and unfinished basements. Electricians may obtain additional certifications, which demonstrate competency in areas such as solar photovoltaic, electrical generating, or lighting systems.

<p>Gently push the new, wired switch back into the electrical box and screw it in place. One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting is a great deterrent to thieves who thrive under the cover of darkness. Also, replace any frayed power cords on electrical appliances you use.
