<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
<p>Pop-up functionality for the past projects makes it easy for viewers to click on a project and learn more without leaving the page they're on. Showcasing project images with an image slider allows the company to share lots of photos of the same project in an easy to see, condensed overview.

It might be possible, but it would require that each outlet have the same wires in it. A half hot requires two colored wires, usually black and red, but it could be two black wires.</p>
<p>Protection of AC motors, requirements, overload protection, currents during starting and stalled point, operation of motors under three-phase unbalanced power supply, motor de-rating due to unbalanced currents, stator and rotor protection, single-phase over-current relays, phase unbalance relays, faults in stator and rotor windings, earth faults, phase-to-phase faults, modern relay design and applications, protection targeting AC synchronous motors, over-voltage and under-frequency protection.</p>
