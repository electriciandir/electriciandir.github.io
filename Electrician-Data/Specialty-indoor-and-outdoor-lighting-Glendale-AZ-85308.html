Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>

After that, remove the screws on the light switch itself and gently pull it out of the wall.</p>
