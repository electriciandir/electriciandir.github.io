Splice into the permanently hot wire, putting it to the second switch. Always assume that power lines, even if they have come down, carry an electrical charge. Many devices use wall warts - plugs that convert AC power into DC power and look like little boxes with electrical prongs sticking out. When it comes to natural gas, as long as you have it coming to your property, there is no reason why you shouldn't be using a generator powered by it. You will basically have unlimited fuel, and not have to worry about refilling, or running out.</p>

Fuses can only be used once; when a current is running at a level that's too high, the fuse will interrupt the electrical flow by melting.</p>
<p>Charging stations for electric vehicles can increase power consumption as much as 50 amps at 220 volts. After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
