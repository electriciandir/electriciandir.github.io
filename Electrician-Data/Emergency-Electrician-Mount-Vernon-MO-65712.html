Energy auditing, quality control, training and inspection services are available. Electricity can cause fires because of the heat that is generated. There are choices in outdoor lighting that homeowners can successfully install, but unless you are a certified and licensed electrician it is best to stick with solar lighting for doing it yourself. Uplighting is a landscape lighting technique that illuminates an area, surface or object from below to create a focal point in the landscape.</p>

Most programs provide everything you need to work in residential settings, but to become a commercial electrician or to work in a specialty area you may need additional training and licensing.
