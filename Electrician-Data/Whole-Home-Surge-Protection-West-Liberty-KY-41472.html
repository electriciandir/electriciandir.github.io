Unlike small standby generators that can only use natural gas or propane, whole home generators also have a diesel option which makes power more accessible.</p>
<p>Breakers that trip regularly, however, signal a larger issue like an overloaded circuit. Single-phase motors normally are limited to fractional horsepower ratings up to 5 horsepower.
