<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>If that is the case, the switch leg of the circuit, from the switch to the outlet, may be white, and the yellow wire spliced to it in order not to have a white wire on the brass screws.
