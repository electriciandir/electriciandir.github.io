<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box.

Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
<p>If you notice any of these signs, it's wise to have an electrician come into your home and assess your breaker box and the rest of your electrical system.

In Florida, the current minimum amperage for an electrical panel is a 100 amp service but many older homes do not even have this capacity. For lights, turn the light switch on and off to be sure. In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
