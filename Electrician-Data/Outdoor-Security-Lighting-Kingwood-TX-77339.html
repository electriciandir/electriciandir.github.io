There are choices in outdoor lighting that homeowners can successfully install, but unless you are a certified and licensed electrician it is best to stick with solar lighting for doing it yourself. Uplighting is a landscape lighting technique that illuminates an area, surface or object from below to create a focal point in the landscape.</p>
<p>If a 14-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 15 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be used to protect that circuit.
