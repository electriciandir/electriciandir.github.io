The same can be said if you do have a modern circuit breaker box, but find that you have to reset your circuit breakers too often. The hot wire and the switched wire are connected with that tab, making both wires hot all the time, whether in that outlet or another on the same switch. Creative lighting can produce dramatic effects that show off the beauty of your home and accentuate the landscape.

<p>Gently push the new, wired switch back into the electrical box and screw it in place. One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
