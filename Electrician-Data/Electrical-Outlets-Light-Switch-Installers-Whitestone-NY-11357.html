<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source. If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>

Some questions about local, state, and national electricity codes may address areas not utilized by certain candidates during electrician training.

Similarly PIR detectors switch lights on when someone approaches, and these are often built in to security lights.</p>

This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement. With our thorough electrical safety inspections , we'll be able to identify any problems or issues your system may have and repair them properly. At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
