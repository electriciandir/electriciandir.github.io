If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value. As skilled tradesmen that perform highly specialized and potentially dangerous work, electricians are subject to strict licensing requirements that must be met to legally practice their craft.</p>
