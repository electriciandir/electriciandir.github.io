<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
<p>Repairs should never be made on live electrical circuits. The transfer switch also comes with a NEMA 3R enclosure that is suited for both indoor and outdoor installation.
