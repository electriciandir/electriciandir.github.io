<p>The idea of a home energy audit is simple. The best fuel-efficient standby generator. Many people think of these power surges only occur during lightening storms. Before choosing a generator, particularly standby generators, you'll need to decide what equipment you want it to run. Whether you want an electrical panel upgrade or you need repair, we're ready to help. But for a permanent hard-wire installation, more precautions must be made to be Class 2 compliant. When you call Penny Electric after hours, you will always be connected with a live representative who will immediately dispatch an emergency electrician or crew to your business location in Henderson or Las Vegas.</p>

Some electrical contractors have their own training programs, which are not recognized apprenticeship programs but include both classroom and on-the-job training.</p>
<p>Continuing education, including courses that offer unique certifications, can not only keep electricians up-to-date, but can look very nice on a resume. Some electricians may eventually pursue careers as drafter, elevator installers, and line repairers.
