Because of low voltage lightings reputation for being a safe and effective system when properly installed, it is taken for granted by some and the basic safety precautions normally taken when working with voltage that can kill you are not always followed.</p>
<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>

Move slowly to ensure the wires don't loosen or break if you have to force the switch into position. Service IS Our Business, call today.
