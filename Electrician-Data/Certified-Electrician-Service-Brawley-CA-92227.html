<p>Most people know that surge suppression protects sensitive electronics, but they would struggle to explain why it's necessary. Two great experiences in a row with TLC - great service and quick resolutions to our issues. For controlling the low-voltage-operated switching relays that in turn operate 120V devices in buildings (lights, receptacles), very thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls. There's no way to know how much protection a device has left, or if the initial rating is even accurate. We purchased a Generac full house generator from Kegley Electric.</p>
<p>Class B Electrician: Must complete 3,000 hours of work in residential or farmstead wiring in 1 to 2-family dwellings under a Class B or Master electrician. Finally, as with all electrical or mechanical devices, wear and tear, age and the effects of the elements can create damage that requires repair or replacement. For some houses, an upgrade to copper electrical wiring may be necessary. Therefore if your "plug" (wall receptacle) is not working, the green screw and ground wire are not the problem.</p>
<p>The meter-base surge suppressor offers protection from surges through the electrical lines. To handle increased electrical loads, it's likely you'll also need to upgrade electrical wiring, especially if your house is more than 40 years old.
