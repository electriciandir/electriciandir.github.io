Let's start with our electrical wire, the two most common electrical wire sizes, that will be used in most homes, will be 14 and 12 gauge electrical wire. Low-Voltage Electrical Cable: The cable used for landscape lighting is specifically made for burial underground.</p>
<p>While only lasting for a few microseconds, lightning causes a dangerous voltage surge that can destroy your electronic devices. But lightning is by no means the major cause of power surges. Over time, light switches will wear out.
