<p>Residential electricians are likely the type of electrician who we are all most familiar with. Even though you might not realize it now, electrical service panels do get overlooked, since they are not in plain site for most homeowners. Always connect the white wire to the neutral terminal of outlets and light fixtures. Cross lighting is achieved by mounting lights on either side of an object to reveal detail and soften shadows.

<p>Homes today have significantly higher power requirements due to the increasing dependency on electronics, computers, home entertainment systems , improved lighting and modern appliances. An electrical system includes incoming power lines, the electric meter, the service panel, subpanels, household wiring, electrical boxes, the receptacles or outlets, switches, appliances, lights, and extra equipment used for home entertainment or communication. The white wire may be connected somewhere in the circuitry or it may be found at the back of the junction box.</p>
<p>Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets.

It is also possible that the original wiring used a black wire to splice to the black panel wire, returning a white wire (that should have been painted black!) to the outlet - if that is the case then that "white that should be black" should terminate on the brass screws of the outlet, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>It can also enhance security by increasing the lighting around the outside of your home at night if you choose to install them outdoors.
