Not only can preventive electrical maintenance save businesses time and money, but by keeping equipment functioning properly, the risk of hazard is greatly reduced and the work environment becomes a safer place.</p>
<p>Surge protectors more commonly protect equipment from lower-voltage surges that occur frequently in modern electrical wiring. The total amperage of the branch circuit breakers serving the house should not exceed the amperage of the panel. As you see in the photo above, typically aluminum electrical branch circuit wiring was plastic-covered. Line voltage lighting include table lamps and most ceiling fixtures.
