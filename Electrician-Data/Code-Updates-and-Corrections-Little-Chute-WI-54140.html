These are directly hooked to your electrical wiring and to a peripheral gas line (natural gas, propane, or diesel).</p>

You will, of course, need an already existing outlet that is half switched or will need to add a switch yourself. Neatly fold the wires into the box in this order: grounds, neutrals and then hots.

<p>This was fine in the past, but homes usually require updated panels to handle the higher payloads of modern-day electronics. Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors. To modify the outlet for use as half-hot, use a screwdriver or a pair of needle-nose pliers to twist and break that small connecting tab.</p>

Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. A new 12-2 (black, white and ground) wire will need to be installed to the porch, with the black terminated on the new switch, the neutral and ground of the new wire spliced to the neutral and ground already in the box.</p>
