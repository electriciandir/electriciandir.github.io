Ambient light is often found in the form of recessed lighting or other types of ceiling lights. A light switch is inexpensive and has small parts entirely contained inside a plastic casing, so if the switch is bad the best option is to replace it.

<p>Now, I'd guess this is how things are connected in the light switch box: neutral from outlet box to lights via wire nut, hot from outlet box to switch, and hot from switch to lights via wire nut. Your transformer needs to be the right wattage to accommodate the lighting you plan to install. If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal.
