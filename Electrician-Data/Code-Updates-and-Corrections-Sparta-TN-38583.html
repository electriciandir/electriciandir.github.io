The two receptacles in a common "duplex" receptacle receive power from the same circuit leading from the main electrical supply panel.

We want to help ensure your home's electrical system remains safe so any problems won't cause further damage.

Some states provide certifications to electricians instead of licenses, and individuals at all levels of this profession must have one to work in the state.</p>
