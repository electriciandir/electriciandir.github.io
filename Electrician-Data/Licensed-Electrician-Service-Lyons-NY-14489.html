<p>While it's always a good idea to have a back up plan for power, it can be extremely confusing to make a choice when selecting generators for home and business use. Have the lighting professional take care of making these adjustments for you, and leave the programming instructions with you. Now use a square-blade shovel to cut a 2- to 3-inch-deep trench along the line where you want the light fixtures. Condition of existing wiring and fixtures. However, if you experience frequent breaker trips or dimming lights, it may mean your electrical panel can't handle the load and is due for an upgrade. Our electricians always put your needs first, so we guarantee 100% satisfaction.</p>
