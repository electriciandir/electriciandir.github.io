Or you can also show 16,000 hours of experience for over 8 years. JMC Electrical Contractor LLC is an electrical contracting firm based in Southeast Michigan.

<p>With a properly planned electrical maintenance schedule and a reliable contractor, you should never have the need to attempt to replace your old wiring or something like that, because that would be a dangerous thing to attempt a DIY on. If you know you've had a serious electrical event (like lighting blew out a transformer down the street), it's probably worth replacing your surge protector just in case.
