<p>This is the comprehensive guide to all types of electrical switches and sockets that are commonly used in your home. Conduct generator maintenance and repairs as needed. AC motors represent industry's workhorse in all applications. With their low wattage and longevity, LED fixtures can work well to supply emergency lighting.

<p>Some electricians â especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code â will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,â Volpe says.
