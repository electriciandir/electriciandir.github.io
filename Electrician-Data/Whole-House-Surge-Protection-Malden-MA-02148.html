<p>Choose between natural gas generators and propane generators based on what's available in your area. Portable generators can handle brief power outages; they are capable of powering your essential appliances during an outage. Because LEDs run on low power, back-up batteries for lighting systems can generate light for a longer time than a traditional system, or can provide more light from a smaller battery. Constant voltage will power LED arrays with a steady voltage regardless of current.</p>
<p>Since they're made to work as a pair, I made sure to attach the red traveler wire to the blue terminal on both switches.

Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. A new 12-2 (black, white and ground) wire will need to be installed to the porch, with the black terminated on the new switch, the neutral and ground of the new wire spliced to the neutral and ground already in the box.</p>
