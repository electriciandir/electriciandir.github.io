<p>Electricians need the right tools and equipment to perform their job easily and properly. A boiler feed pump being powered by two 3500 hp induction motors appears to be developing a problem.

Closed doors create damaged cords. Power surges (also known as transient voltage events), are increases in voltage that are well above the normal flow of electric power.</p>
<p>Electrical work is defined in the Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991 and means work on electrical machines or instruments, on an electrical installation or on electrical appliances or equipment to which electricity is supplied or intended to be supplied, at a nominal pressure exceeding 50 volts alternating current or 120 volts direct current, whether or not the thing on which the work is being performed is part of, or is connected to or to be connected to, any distribution works or private generating plant and, where work is performed on any appliance, whether or not electricity is supplied or may be supplied thereto through an electric plug socket or socket outlet.</p>
<p>Enjoy the beauty of your landscape (and sure footing) after sunset with low voltage lighting.

The transfer switch has a NEMA 3R enclosure that allows for both indoor and outdoor installation. In order to work unsupervised, an electrical worker must be a licensed electrician.
