<p>Need a Generator Installation? In times of emergencies, portable generators provide the most economical way of supplying back up power. The lower wattage of LED lamp fixtures provides improved performance for a mere fraction of the energy use of other lighting. There is no project too big or too small for the Rawhide Electrical Services team. If there is a light, the blue wire should be connected to the black wire of the switch as well.

<p>The cost of outdoor lighting varies from one property to another. The Briggs & Stratton 40445 is a suitable backup power solution for smaller households and businesses.
