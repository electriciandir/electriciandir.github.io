Consider matching your modern home décor with some contemporary lighting fixtures that feature simple geometric forms and chic, industrial finishes. Leave the hot wire extra long and fold it back and forth across the bottom of the box.

Whether you create a patio, barbecue island, or a full outdoor kitchen, you have a great place for entertaining, spending time with family, or just getting some fresh air in the safety of your own home. Portable gas generators can be significantly less expensive to operate than other choices. Normally that switch would be running at least one half of at least one of those outlets.
