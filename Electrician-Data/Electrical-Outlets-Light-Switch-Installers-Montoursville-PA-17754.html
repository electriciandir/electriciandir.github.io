<p>When these are incorrect, due to faulty installation or changes made after installation, you need a professional electrician with a good meter to determine where the problems lie. Over time, due to settling of your building, dust, humidity, chemicals, or other atmospheric conditions, the wires connecting the breakers and circuits of your electrical panel can become loose and corroded. Needless to say this is much more than you will probably need for most of your home outdoor lighting projects.</p>
<p>Or when you turned it on, it could have added too much of a load to what's already turned on. In that case, consider having an electrical repairman install a new circuit breaker with a higher rating.

Safety became an important part of the electrician's trade due to the risk involved not only for the electrician but for everyone involved with electrical appliances.</p>
