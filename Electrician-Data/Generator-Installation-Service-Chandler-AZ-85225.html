<p>Trends like this aren't surprising, given that during Hurricane Sandy three in four people in the Connecticut, New Jersey and New York areas lost power from their utility company for at least one day, with a median of seven days of power loss, according to a survey from the Consumer Reports National Research Center People see that one house on their street that had power throughout the storm, and they want a generator,” says Dan Giampetroni, a business manager at Kohler.</p>

Constant voltage will power LED arrays with a steady voltage regardless of current.</p>
<p>Electricians held about 583,500 jobs in 2012, of which 61 percent were employed in the electrical contractors and other wiring installation contractors industry.
