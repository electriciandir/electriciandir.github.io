<p>Simulations are a realistic yet completely safe way to learn a high-risk skill, such as troubleshooting electrical systems. A common electrical upgrade involves installing ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) on receptacles and arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) on breakers. New houses typically come and a 200-amp service and an electrical panel that is suitable for handling the load of modern appliances.

If the outlet is already switched, but the tab is not broken, it means that both halves are switched.

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger. Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device.

<p>Electrical installing work must be carried out by a licensed electrical contractor, who in turn must employ licensed electricians.
