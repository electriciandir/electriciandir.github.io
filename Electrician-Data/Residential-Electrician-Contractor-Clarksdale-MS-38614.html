Fuse panels used in homes normally do no allow for enough circuits that todays modern home reqire. Therefore, when a controller breaks down, it is essential for electrical maintenance personnel to know how to locate the cause of the controller malfunction and be able to make the necessary corrections.</p>

Your circuit breaker should be labeled and diagrammed somewhere in the service panel, most often inside the cover lid. Even the most effective surge protectors can not protect equipment from the sudden increase in electrical pressure of millions of volts that lightning can supply. A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot.
