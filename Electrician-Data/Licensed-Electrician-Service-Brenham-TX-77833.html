Depending on your energy needs and the type of electrical panel being installed, costs may vary widely. The two conductor cable from the ceiling box to the light switch is supposed to have the white conductor re-identified with another color because it is not being used as a neutral, but as a hot wire.</p>
<p>Unlike the silent portable units , a standby whole house generator is installed permanently on a concrete pad and connected directly to your home's electric box to provide uninterrupted power that can kick in automatically. Electrical panels are also referred to as breaker panel, electrical service, circuit breaker panel, distribution board, or panel board.
