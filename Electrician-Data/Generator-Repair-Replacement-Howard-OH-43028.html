Likewise, the new ground wire is spliced into the circuit at the receptacle. This will ensure that all of the fixtures in your lighting design are receiving adequate energy to function at their full desired brightness.</p>
<p>If the wiring condition is ok, note which wire connects to which terminal and label one of the wires with a small piece of electrical insulation tape.
