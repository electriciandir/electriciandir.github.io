With a more reliable, high capacity electrical panel, we can ensure that your system is up to code and put important safeguards into place. And you don't change the colors because the outlet is mounted in what most would consider "upside-down"; the black wires always go to the brass screws, not the silver ones.</p>

Choosing the route in which your power cables will be placed is also a critical aspect of a successful wiring layout.

Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.

You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
