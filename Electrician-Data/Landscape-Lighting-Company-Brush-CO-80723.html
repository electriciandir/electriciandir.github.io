Connect the new switch or outlet by connecting the wires to the screw terminals as described above. If you have two-pronged, non-grounded receptacle outlets in your home, you should consider upgrading to three-prong, grounded receptacle outlets. Diesel units come with their own tanks, but diesel fuel is expensive and needs regular treatment so that it doesn't clog the engine over time.</p>

The power supply cannot be installed in a concealed location behind drywall or where access is rendered inaccessible without damaging or destroying the building finish.</p>
