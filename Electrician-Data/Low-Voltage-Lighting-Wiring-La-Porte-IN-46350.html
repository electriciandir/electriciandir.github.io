<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.

Fold the ground wires neatly into the back of the box (Photo 11). Depending on when the wiring was done, there may be completely different colors for your wires.

<p>However, there may be local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check these before you begin work. Licenses are issued by the State Electrical Board of North Dakota.
