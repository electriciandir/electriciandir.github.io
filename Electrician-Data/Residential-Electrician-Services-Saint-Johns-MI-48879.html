<p>Propane and gas powered generators are good and efficient but compared to diesel generators, they will need more maintenance. Some landscape lighting systems operate on "line voltage," the 120-volt current from your house. AMP® fixtures are built to last as long as the LEDs they house. Smaller, portable generators for home are great for powering the essentials, like the refrigerator and microwave, while large standby power generators can power everything in your house.</p>
