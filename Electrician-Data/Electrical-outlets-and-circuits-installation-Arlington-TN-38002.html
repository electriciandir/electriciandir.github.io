<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician in Arlington</h2>
<p>The disruption of power for substantial lengths of time can occur at any time due to hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, snowfall and other natural calamities. You do not need to be an expert contractor to install your lighting system. And surge protection plays a more important role than ever before. Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>

<p>If that's the case the outlet could be turned into a half hot by using the black and following directions in the article, cutting the tab on the brass side and putting both the black and red wires on it. An Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) handles the entire operation of the generator back-up of your home. Outlets and switches get the heaviest use of all electrical system components.
