Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value. As skilled tradesmen that perform highly specialized and potentially dangerous work, electricians are subject to strict licensing requirements that must be met to legally practice their craft.</p>

As the fire burns it melts other wiring in the structure and since these are also "protected" by FPE circuit breakers they do not trip. It's necessary for emergencies when you don't need to waste time to figure out which switch controls what circuit.</p>

<p>This will likely require removing them from the outlet and splicing the two existing black wires, along with two short additional pieces of black wire, into one wire nut. Only use extension cords approved for the environment and loads expected. With 2 short hot wires and 3 neutrals, I connected a pair of the hot and neutral each to back-wire clamps, and used the side screw for the last neutral.

Unlike diesel generators there is more maintenance involved in these. I'd give serious consideration to hiring an electrician that will allow you to do lots of the mundane work like nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up.
