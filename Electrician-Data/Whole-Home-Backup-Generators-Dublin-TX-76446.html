<h3>An Introduction To Your Home's Electrical System Dublin TX 76446</h3>
<p>When using extension cords for outside use, make sure that the extension cords are rated for outdoor use and ensure the connections are shielded from the weather. For the most part, they are used in applications such as commercial parking garage lighting, warehouse lighting, and certain outdoor applications such as security flood lighting. Another popular trend in outdoor lighting is small lights that are clustered together and hidden in plants.

If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal.
