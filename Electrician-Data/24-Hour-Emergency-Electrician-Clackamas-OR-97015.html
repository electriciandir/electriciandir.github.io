<p>In addition to adding beauty to your home and accentuating its features, outdoor lighting is also an essential security element. Like accent lighting, they are able to give you a great control over what areas are lit, and are able to add lighting to a room without overpowering it.

So to keep everyone safe, landscape lighting manufacturers settled on 12 volts as a standard.</p>
