Special versions of non-metallic sheathed cables, such as US Type UF, are designed for direct underground burial (often with separate mechanical protection) or exterior use where exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a possibility.</p>
<p>The outlet has a circuit breaker incorporated into the outlet which trips if too much current is drawn or if a short occurs because of moisture.
