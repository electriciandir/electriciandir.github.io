<p>Here's something that may surprise you: Power surges aren't always stormy, lightning-fueled events that fry your electronics.

In contrast to older halogen lighting systems LED lighting systems can run for years without a bulb failure. Electrical knowledge is not required for the do-it-yourself installation.</p>
<p>Most standby generators are big. Electrical panels installed after 2000 are quite safe and reliable. On an ungrounded electrical circuit you should install only two-prong, ungrounded receptacles - that is code compliant and that also lets users know that there is no reliable electrical ground present.
