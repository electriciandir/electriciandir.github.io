Generally, the rule is that the generator should be located as close as possible to the fuel supply and transfer switch. In fact the only opportunity for danger when handling or installation is when making the connection to the standard voltage power source or when using a much too small wire size. Electricians passionate about their profession should find numerous opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
