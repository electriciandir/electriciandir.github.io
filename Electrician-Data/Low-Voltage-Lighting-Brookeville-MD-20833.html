We have all the whole house standby generator systems that you need.</p>
<p>Class B Electrician: Must complete 3,000 hours of work in residential or farmstead wiring in 1 to 2-family dwellings under a Class B or Master electrician. Finally, as with all electrical or mechanical devices, wear and tear, age and the effects of the elements can create damage that requires repair or replacement. For some houses, an upgrade to copper electrical wiring may be necessary. Therefore if your "plug" (wall receptacle) is not working, the green screw and ground wire are not the problem.</p>

Older homes often lack sufficient electrical circuits to meet the demand of modern life. Leave your electrical panel replacement needs to the professionals at Electric Man.

<p>They recommend that any home that is over 40 years old, has had major renovation or major appliances added over 10 years ago or is changing owners receive an electrical inspection. If you have relied on a fuse box for decades you should consider replacing it because as the electricity heats it up, the electrical connections within the panel become weaken.
