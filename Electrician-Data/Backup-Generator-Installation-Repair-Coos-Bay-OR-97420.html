<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
<p>If the main is a breaker, the overload rating size is typically on the handle, or immediately adjacent, e.g. 200, 175, or 150 (Amps). With a generator, you'll never lose time or money due to a power outage again. Because electricity travels on the outside of copper wire, wires are insulated to protect against fire and shock. Leave one bare ground wire long, and snip the rest to 6 in. beyond the box. If a power line is broken stay as far away as possible to reduce the risk of electrical shock.</p>

Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
