Contractor License: Master electricians and firms can obtain it addressing the Delaware Division of Revenue. To support the increased demand, the company has since 2011 added nearly 1,000 dealers of residential and light commercial generators to its network.

If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4. Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
