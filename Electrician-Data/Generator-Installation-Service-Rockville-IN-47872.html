<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician in Rockville</h2>
<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do. You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>
<p>To find out if a particular model of computer surge protector is worth the money or not, try to find some product reviews online. Almost all electricians work full time, which may include evenings and weekends. There are several differences between 120 volt and 12 volt (low voltage) outdoor landscape lighting systems. If you suspect your electrical panel is one of these outdated models, be sure to contact an electrician right away to discuss a replacement. An electric generator continues to create electricity even if there's a widespread power outage.</p>
<p>Some in-ground fixtures come with covers, leaf-guards or gravel screens. You can use the existing wires, but be aware that after a long time, the wires will be stiff and coated in dirt. That's why hiring a residential electrician is important in keeping you safe and making sure your electrical repairs are done to code. Some homeowners want the generator installed in a garage since there is already a concrete floor and the unit will be out of the weather and safe from thieves.</p>

<p>A surge protector removes the threat of your home catching on fire because of too much power supply. Start by running the wires from the light assembly through the riser base and attach the stake. Do the same with the black wires. Even if you are not noticing any signs of failure or overload, but you know that your electrical panel is a few decades old, it may be time to replace it. On average, it has a service life of 25-40 years. An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians.</p>
<p>11 18 19 The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology. The two receptacles in a common "duplex" receptacle receive power from the same circuit leading from the main electrical supply panel. Without a surge protector, anything higher than 120V can create component issues, such as permanent damage, reduced lifespan of internal devices, burned wires and data loss.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot. Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months. Electrical Contractors are not issued with a plastic licence card but are issued with a Certificate of Registration.</p>

<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets. Low voltage systems run on voltages lower than 30 volts DC (usually 12 or 24 volts) and use a 'Class 2' power source. Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments. Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>

Not a concern when using the 12 volt system. If you were to have a surge protector on and plugged into a lamp with a lightning strike occurred your light bulb will not explode and it would most likely still work the next day.</p>
