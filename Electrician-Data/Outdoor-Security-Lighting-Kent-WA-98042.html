Or if the top and bottom outlets of a duplex receptacle are powered by two different circuits, the hot tab and possibly the neutral tab will be removed. If the switch is grounded, remove the grounding wire last.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring.
