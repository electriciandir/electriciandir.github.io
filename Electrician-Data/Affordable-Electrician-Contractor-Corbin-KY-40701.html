If you hear any popping, crackling, sizzling, or buzzing coming from your outlets, switches, or appliances, there could be a serious problem. Backup house generators often differ in what fuel source they use to generator their power. For example, if a circuit breaker repeatedly trips after being reset, electricians determine the cause and fix it.</p>
<p>Unlike the silent portable units , a standby whole house generator is installed permanently on a concrete pad and connected directly to your home's electric box to provide uninterrupted power that can kick in automatically. Electrical panels are also referred to as breaker panel, electrical service, circuit breaker panel, distribution board, or panel board.

<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this.
