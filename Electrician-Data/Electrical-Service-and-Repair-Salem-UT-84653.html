Additionally, Generac, one of the leaders in home power, has a good guide to the cost of one of their systems. The Romex-style wires have white outer sheathing, and so I'm assuming 14 gauge. Another residential technology that is seeing dramatic growth is solar power, which was the fastest growing electric source in the United States in 2011, according to recent findings by the Solar Electric Power Association.</p>
