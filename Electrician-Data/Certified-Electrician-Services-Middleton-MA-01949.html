<p>Other terms you may have heard used to refer to your service panel include fuse box, circuit breaker, or fuse box panel. When MCBs are switched off or tipped off, the electric supply to the affected circuit is cut off.

Electric generation systems such as power plant equipment and hydroelectric energy are also managed by them. Older homes likely have outdated electrical outlets. Aluminum also has high electrical resistance, so it's difficult for current to flow through it. This means an aluminum wired home will have more electrical losses than one that's wired with copper.</p>
<p>Make sure extension and lamp cords are not strung through areas where people will be walking. I worry about everything from proper hook shape to wondering why I can't fold wires back into electrical boxes with the same ease as they fold out. Still, a whole house protector can provide you with the guarantee that your home and its inhabitants get decent protection against power upsurge. Lumens refers to the amount of light that comes from a bulb and tells you about how bright the bulb is and how intense the light is. How many lumens you need generally depends on where you're planning to use your landscape lighting.</p>
<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem. If you are noticing frequent circuit breaker trips, it may be coming from an old panel that cannot deliver enough electrical power for a modern home. They come in different sizes, and it's important to make sure the right size wire is connected to the right size circuit breaker.</p>
