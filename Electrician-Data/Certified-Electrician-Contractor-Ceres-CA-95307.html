Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected.

<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch.
