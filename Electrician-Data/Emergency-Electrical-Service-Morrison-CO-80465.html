Electrical contractors who do electrical work for the public, as opposed to electricians who work for electrical contractors, often need a special license. Whole house generator installation costs for electrical contractors range from $60-$100 per hour to wire the generator to the electrical panel plus the cost of wire and additional supplies. However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>

If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit.
