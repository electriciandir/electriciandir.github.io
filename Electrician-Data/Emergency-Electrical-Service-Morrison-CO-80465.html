You will need to bend or break off one of the new electrical box tabs in the back to run the wire through. Electrical contractors who do electrical work for the public, as opposed to electricians who work for electrical contractors, often need a special license. Whole house generator installation costs for electrical contractors range from $60-$100 per hour to wire the generator to the electrical panel plus the cost of wire and additional supplies. However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>
<p>The purpose of a standby generator is to anticipate a power cut and be able to supply the required power output.

At Hoffman Electrical, our electricians take pride in our work.</p>
<p>You can also use a sharp knife to slit the sheath, but if you nick the insulation on the electric wire, cut the cable off at that point and try again.

Since air was free to circulate over the wires, smaller conductors could be used than required in cables.</p>
<p>Smaller service panels have less room for circuits, and those circuits are usually rated for lower amp draw than larger panels.

<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords. There may be other wires in the box, but you are only dealing with the ones connected directly to the switch. If the power originates in the outlet then that white wire is most likely not a neutral at all, but either a constant hot or a switched hot.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity.
