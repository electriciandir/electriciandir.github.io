If you know you've had a serious electrical event (like lighting blew out a transformer down the street), it's probably worth replacing your surge protector just in case. Loose or broken wires that are still slightly touching will allow the light switch to function.</p>

Take Your Surge Protector for a Spin by Grgegory Schmidt, The New York Times, January 30, 2013. Understanding what your expected load is in the event of a power outage is a key component of choosing the right generator.
