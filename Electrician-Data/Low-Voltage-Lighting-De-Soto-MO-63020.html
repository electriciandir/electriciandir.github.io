<h3>Fundamentals of Working With a Licensed Electrical Contractor in De Soto MO</h3>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
<p>Watch out: we do not wire fixed lighting fixtures such as ceiling lights on the same circuit as electrical receptacles ("wall plugs"). But depending on how the building is wired, you may not have an acceptable neutral wire, and in some still older circuits you may not have a safe ground wire.
