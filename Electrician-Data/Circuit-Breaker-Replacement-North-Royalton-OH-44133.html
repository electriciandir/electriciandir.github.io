Some older homes will have electrical panels that are not suited to handle the electrical demands of modern homes.</p>
<p>Portable generators must run outdoors. You don't need to stumble around in the dark, rain or bad weather to pull the starter cord on your standby generator, as you do with a portable.

<p>Since they're made to work as a pair, I made sure to attach the red traveler wire to the blue terminal on both switches. Perhaps your competitors have a formula for how to run a successful electrical business that's more potent than yours.
