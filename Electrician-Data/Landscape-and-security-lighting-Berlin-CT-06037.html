If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
<p>If you want to introduce new appliances, electrical panel replacement or upgrade will be a good idea. One drawback to low voltage systems is that dim lights from the voltage drop can occur over long distances.
