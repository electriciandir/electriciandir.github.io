<p>Simulations are a realistic yet completely safe way to learn a high-risk skill, such as troubleshooting electrical systems. A common electrical upgrade involves installing ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) on receptacles and arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) on breakers. New houses typically come and a 200-amp service and an electrical panel that is suitable for handling the load of modern appliances. It's not a wise decision to rely on the light you get from your neighbors or street lights when strolling through your yard.</p>
<p>If you have already purchased solar lighting fixtures or low voltage lights, place them where you would like them. Never attempt to perform this job when the main power to the house is turned on.

If you want your residential or commercial generator to last as long as possible and enjoy an effective working life, preventative maintenance can be a helpful step.</p>

<p>So, if you have a 3-ton (36,000BTU) air conditioner, for example, it will require a standby generator that is 11kW or larger.
