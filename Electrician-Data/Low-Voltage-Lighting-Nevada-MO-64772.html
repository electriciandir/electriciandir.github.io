However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>
<p>Repairs should never be made on live electrical circuits. The transfer switch also comes with a NEMA 3R enclosure that is suited for both indoor and outdoor installation. Though they work in different ways, they all protect the user against accidental electric shock and electrocution by acting immediately to shut off power to the appliance upon the detection of a leak” of electric current as may happen when a hair dryer falls into a sink full of water.

A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
<p>Electrical safety needs to be taught to children early on. Safety plugs should be inserted in unused outlets when toddlers are in the home. For example, when an outlet is not working, they may use a multimeter to check the voltage, amperage, or resistance to determine the best course of action.
