<p>There are many parameters that have to be met when one is selecting that ideal Surge Protection Devices as well as circuit breakers. Most transformers are equipped with a 24-hour timer that allows users to decide when the lights go on and off automatically.

The effectiveness of low voltage lighting systems have drastically improved over the years.
