For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>

Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
<p>If the main is a breaker, the overload rating size is typically on the handle, or immediately adjacent, e.g. 200, 175, or 150 (Amps).

Power generators are not as expensive as you might think. Our polite electricians will look after your home and needs with respect.
