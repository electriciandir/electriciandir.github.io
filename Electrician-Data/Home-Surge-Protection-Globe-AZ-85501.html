<p>Whole-house backup generators from BGE HOME will keep the lights on when the power goes out. Journeymen electricians work with mechanical connections, lighting installation, power supplies, security systems and communications in both residences and commercial buildings. When experiencing an electrical emergency in your home, the problem can often range from mildly annoying to downright alarming. Students will master wiring methods used in commercial, industrial and residential wiring, blueprint reading, electrical code, and operating principles of motors, transformers, photovoltaic systems and controlling circuits.</p>
<p>For example, a residential electrician who has not been in business for very long may offer a discount for homeowners who can give referrals. DON'T yank an electrical cord from the wall.

Many of these fixtures are also dimmable, but not all, so if you're shopping for LED and want to use a dimmer, check on this before you buy (you'll also need to get a special dimmer switch that works with LED lights).</p>
