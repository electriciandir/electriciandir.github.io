When experiencing an electrical emergency in your home, the problem can often range from mildly annoying to downright alarming. Students will master wiring methods used in commercial, industrial and residential wiring, blueprint reading, electrical code, and operating principles of motors, transformers, photovoltaic systems and controlling circuits.</p>
