Consider matching your modern home décor with some contemporary lighting fixtures that feature simple geometric forms and chic, industrial finishes. Leave the hot wire extra long and fold it back and forth across the bottom of the box. If your voltage drop is over 8%, I would recommend shortening your wire run, removing lights from your run or running two separate systems to allow for the excess wattage and length your wanting to power.</p>
<p>Since old wiring and temporary wiring can cause fire , damage and death, it doesn't come as a surprise that you will get a home insurance discount when updating your homes wiring system.
