<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment.

And, due to the bulb being much cooler than conventional lighting, low voltage lighting can be used in areas that are prone to getting warm without any more discomfort or worry about overheating electrical components.
