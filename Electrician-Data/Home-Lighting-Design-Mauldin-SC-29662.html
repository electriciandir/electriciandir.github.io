Breaker panels work by providing a certain amount of power, measured in amperes. Your electrical system is a complex series of connections and wiring, but it all goes back to one main source, your breaker panel. Since air was free to circulate over the wires, smaller conductors could be used than required in cables.</p>

At Stack Electric, we offer all of our services in emergency situations. So if there is an option, use the power already in the outlet box. Many older homes using fuses or low amp breaker panels are good candidates for an upgrade to a safer and higher capacity, circuit breaker panel.</p>
