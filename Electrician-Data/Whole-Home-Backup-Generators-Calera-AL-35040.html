<p>It is strongly recommended that you consider getting what is called a multi-tap transformer if your cable run is going to be more than 10 or 15 feet in length. If you go into your local hardware store when your area is already in the grips of a major power outage, you might find that the generator aisle is a little picked-over.

Tamper-resistant outlet (TRO)â€”an outlet designed to prevent small children from inserting foreign objects into the outlet's sockets An internal spring keeps the sockets closed unless both are triggered at the same time, as by an electrical plug.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>
