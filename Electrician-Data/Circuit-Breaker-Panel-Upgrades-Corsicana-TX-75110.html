Investing in a whole-house generator means you will always have backup power should you need it. Having a licensed electrician perform regular maintenance at your home and office will also lower your risk of problems in the future.</p>

As a result of his interest in low voltage lighting systems I've been looking around the web to see what other resources are available and attempting to pull together some bits of wisdom for designing and installing an outdoor low voltage lighting system.</p>
<p>If you plan on buying individual lights or if you plan on buying a kit, here is one important question you need to ask yourself: "How will the transformer turn on and off?" Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>
<p>The outcome of an electrical shock depends on the size of the current, where it passed through the body, and how long the person was exposed to the current. Power strips or extension cords are often used to allow several different electrical items to pull power from one outlet. 1 out of 5 Easy Digging shallow trenches for the low-voltage cable takes some work, but installing the light fixtures is a piece of cake.
