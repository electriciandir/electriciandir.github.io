<h2>Lighting Installation Lehi Utah</h2>
<p>Replace pathway and garden lights in areas that aren't heavily shaded by large trees. It replaced a hard to crank 7000 watt Home Depot propane generator. An autotransformer connected in a buck configuration (the windings connected together as subtractive rather than additive) would not be an acceptable conversion from line voltage to low voltage for these lighting systems. A GFCI Circuit Breaker can be installed on some circuit breaker electrical panels to protect an entire branch circuit.</p>
<p>You will need a GFCI outlet outside or in the garage, and a transformer that converts 120-volt to 12-volt power.

After that, remove the screws on the light switch itself and gently pull it out of the wall.</p>
