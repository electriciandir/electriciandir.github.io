Troubleshooting variable speed drive (VSD) systems effectively almost always requires in-depth knowledge of the controller, but it also requires broad knowledge of the systems that the drives are often a part of. When things go wrong, the problem is usually not in the controller, but somewhere in the system: in the motor, in the drive's links to the system, or in the electrical supply for the drive or the system.</p>
