For example, in New Jersey, contractor licenses are issued to firms or individuals who can show proof of at least five years of practical experience in electrical construction and installation and pass a written examination. Emergencies can happen at any time of the day, and when you need an urgent repair for your egress lighting, your safety and your occupants' safety shouldn't be left on hold.</p>

Fuel consumption varies depending upon the horsepower rating of the generator's engine.</p>

Across the US, homeowners report spending $1,200-3,000 (labor and materials) on upgrading an outdated service panel to 200 amps.

Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
