A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping. When looking at the green screw of the receptacle terminal, it should be connected to a metal box or electrical box.</p>
<p>In order to wire the outlet boxes many holes would be needed and so they should be drilled and this is to be done when your log erection crew is installing the logs and not later than that. The generator turns on when your utility power is disrupted, and then shuts off and re-enters standby mode as soon as your utility power is restored.
