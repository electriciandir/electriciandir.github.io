<p>The generator's OHVI® engine is designed specifically for generators and provides the utmost reliability to power through severe storms and outages. Solar lights are the most environmental friendly, convenient source of light.

You would require experience in onsite electrical wiring, switchboards, motors etc. The really good news is that there is absolutely no wiring at all in solar outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>If the main is a breaker, the overload rating size is typically on the handle, or immediately adjacent, e.g. 200, 175, or 150 (Amps). With a generator, you'll never lose time or money due to a power outage again. Because electricity travels on the outside of copper wire, wires are insulated to protect against fire and shock. Leave one bare ground wire long, and snip the rest to 6 in. beyond the box. If a power line is broken stay as far away as possible to reduce the risk of electrical shock.</p>
