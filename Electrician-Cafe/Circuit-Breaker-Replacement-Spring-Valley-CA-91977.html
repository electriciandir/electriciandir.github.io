<p>This approach should be substantially less costly and troublesome than attempting to convert all of the switches in the home to 120V design - that would require re-wiring those areas in the home with new 120V wires.

<p>A good electrician will offer you a entire line of surge protectors to accommodate your individual requirements and finances. However, this will not protect your electrical outlet, walls, insulation or your appliances from electrical shocks. Lastly, if you live in an area that promotes dark-sky compliance in outdoor lighting, be sure to select fixtures that are specifically rated as dark-sky compliant. A professionally installed lighting system has been known to increase the value and resale of properties.</p>
<p>Shop from power-house companies like Kichler Lighting , Hinkley Lighting, Artemide, Tech Lighting, Troy Lighting, WAC Lighting , Nuvo Lighting and Eurofase Lighting. Once the lights are assembled, and you are satisfied with the placement, dig a shallow trench for the cable (or the cable can be left above ground, if preferred). Most lighting systems run off of line voltage. At Brentwood Electrical Contractors , we don't limit ourselves to the design and installation of interior lighting.</p>
