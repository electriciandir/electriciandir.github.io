Accent, path, or task lights can be used around the home with different levels of light in a variety of different designs. We make sure that your outdoor lighting system is good as new, by conducting frequent outdoor lighting inspections and repairs, and by making sure that fixtures and glass lenses are clean.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.
