<p>Portable generators are used in homes and in places where there is no power or the need for power is minimum. Standby generators - A standby generator is permanently installed outside your home, and usually runs on propane or natural gas. The electrical panel box is usually installed alongside the electric meter. That's why you always want to make sure you have a computer surge protector between your computer's cable and the power supply you're accessing. Shadowing is created by placing lights in front of an object at ground level and pointing the beam upwards to throw the shadow of the object onto a surface behind it.</p>
