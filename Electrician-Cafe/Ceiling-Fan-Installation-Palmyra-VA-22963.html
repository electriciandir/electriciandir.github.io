Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value. As skilled tradesmen that perform highly specialized and potentially dangerous work, electricians are subject to strict licensing requirements that must be met to legally practice their craft.</p>

A proper plastic covered wires- called NMC or Non Metallic Sheathed Cable- are so far considered the ideal one for indoor wiring. The cost of a sub-panel is usually less than a full-sized breaker panel due to its smaller size, lower amperage rating, and fewer circuit breakers. Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis.
