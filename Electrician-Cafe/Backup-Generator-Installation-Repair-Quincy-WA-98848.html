<p>I temporarily screwed in a a couple of metal tabs (cut from scrap - or you can use a small angle bracket) to the wall-plate screw holes (the support bar from a fan outlet box will also work ).

<p>The black wire from the switch connects to the hot on the receptacle. According to the National Safety Council, electrical hazards are listed as the cause of 4,000 injuries, and around 300 fatalities each year.

The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
