Take Your Surge Protector for a Spin by Grgegory Schmidt, The New York Times, January 30, 2013. Understanding what your expected load is in the event of a power outage is a key component of choosing the right generator. Low voltage systems offer safe, dependable control of lights, motors, and industrial equipment.</p>
<p>Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets.
