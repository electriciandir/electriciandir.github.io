Electric motors use more power to start than they do to run, which means electronic appliances with significant moving parts - such as fans, pumps, compressors on refrigerators, and air conditions - can use up to three times as more electricity to start as they do to run continuously. According to industry testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts and 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including surges from external sources not including lightning strikes.</p>
