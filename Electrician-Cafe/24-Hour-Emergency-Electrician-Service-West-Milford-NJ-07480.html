Specializes in the safe installation and repair of these devices to always keep your family covered.</p>
<p>While only lasting for a few microseconds, lightning causes a dangerous voltage surge that can destroy your electronic devices. But lightning is by no means the major cause of power surges. Over time, light switches will wear out. Additionally, certain non-egress areas should have emergency lighting as well, such as electrical rooms, generator rooms, fire command centers, and fire pump rooms.
