At Hoffman Electrical, our electricians take pride in our work.</p>
<p>An SPD can damp the spike down to a value compatible with that which most connected appliances can withstand: approximately 1.5 kV.

It's basically going to cap the output at a certain wattage or voltage of electricity and return any unwanted electricity back into the home circuit loop. The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of. Whether the attachment method chosen is screws, push-in holes, or pigtailing with wire connectors, enough insulation must be stripped off the wire for good metal-to-metal contact, and wires should be tugged on to check tightness.</p>

Lutron and Touch-Plate offer upgraded systems that would allow you to continue to use your home's wiring, but would require new panels, relays, light switches, and other adaptations. Pigtail wires will require the use of silicone-filled wire nuts for connections. Seriously consider hiring an electrician who will allow you to do lots of the mundane work such as nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up.
