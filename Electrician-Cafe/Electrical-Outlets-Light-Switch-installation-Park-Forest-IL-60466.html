A backup generator delivers power directly to your home's electrical system, backing up your entire home or just the most essential items.</p>
<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock. Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician.

<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
