<p>Today, Portland, Oregon homes are packed with susceptible electronics that are without doubt damaged by ordinary power surges, spikes in electricity or voltage irregularity. All electrical panel replacements require a permit that is issued by the city. Since whole-house generators are powered by your propane or natural gas supply, you'll have generator power for as long as you need it. If a homeowner finds they have more electronics and a greater vested interest in protecting them, or the home is located in an area with frequent power surges, a whole house surge protector can not only protect electronics, but also the wiring of a home.</p>
