<p>Examples of accent lighting include track lights and flood lights. Consider decorative lighting such as pendant lights, chandeliers, and wall sconces. Relays only require a momentay pulse of current to change from one state to another - ON to OFF or OFF to ON. These low voltage switches use momentary contact to control the power, so the small-magnitude, low volt current only flows for the length of time that the switch is being pressed.

All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification. NIST reports that "Sending them surges down the drain of a grounding conductor only makes them reappear within a microsecond about 200 meters away on some other conductor." 35 So having protection on a data transmission line is only required if surges are diverted to the ground line.</p>
