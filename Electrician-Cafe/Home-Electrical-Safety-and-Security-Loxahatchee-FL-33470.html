Energy auditing, quality control, training and inspection services are available. Electricity can cause fires because of the heat that is generated. There are choices in outdoor lighting that homeowners can successfully install, but unless you are a certified and licensed electrician it is best to stick with solar lighting for doing it yourself. Uplighting is a landscape lighting technique that illuminates an area, surface or object from below to create a focal point in the landscape.</p>
<p>Most outdoor lighting systems use low voltage lighting which is employs 12 volts of electrical devices instead of the usual 120 volts that are used at home or in offices.
