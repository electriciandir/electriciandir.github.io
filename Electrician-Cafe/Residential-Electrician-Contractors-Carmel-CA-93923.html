Two great experiences in a row with TLC - great service and quick resolutions to our issues. For controlling the low-voltage-operated switching relays that in turn operate 120V devices in buildings (lights, receptacles), very thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls. There's no way to know how much protection a device has left, or if the initial rating is even accurate. We purchased a Generac full house generator from Kegley Electric.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to suggest that more than half of the energy consumed worldwide is converted by AC motors into work and these are controlled by drives.
