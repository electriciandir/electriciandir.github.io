Leave the hot wire extra long and fold it back and forth across the bottom of the box. If your voltage drop is over 8%, I would recommend shortening your wire run, removing lights from your run or running two separate systems to allow for the excess wattage and length your wanting to power.</p>
<p>If it is a 15 amp breaker, you will need either that same 12-3 or 14-3 wire (14 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground).

These are LC&D (Lighting Controls & Design) low voltage switches. More and more homeowners are realizing the benefits of investing in a lighting design instead of putting all their money of landscape design alone.</p>
