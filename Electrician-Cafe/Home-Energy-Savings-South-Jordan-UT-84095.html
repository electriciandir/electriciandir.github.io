<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities.
