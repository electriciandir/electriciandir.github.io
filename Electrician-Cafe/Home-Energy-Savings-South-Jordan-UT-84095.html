A solar landscape light must be bright enough to safely illuminate walkways, driveways, decks, pool areas and stairways.

<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
<p>Maintenance, repair, assembly, portable machining, logistics, diagnostics and troubleshooting services also offered. If you determine that the starter control voltage is intact and present, suspect a potential open circuit in the motor overloads or control circuit.
