<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light. If you notice lights dimming or flickering when a large appliance kicks on, that means they're on the same circuit and the appliance takes electrical current away from the lights when it turns on. Unscrew the switch from the electrical box and pull it out with the wires still attached. These two components work together to maintain constant electrical power for a home or business when there is an outage.</p>
<p>Devices with surge protection will be like a safety bridge in the even that a transient voltage occurs in your system. With Ethernet surge protectors, we are rounding off our package of solutions for industrial data communication.

The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.
