Flickering lights are a sign that a home is very old, and the panel was designed for about 60 amps of electricity. If you have loose electrical sockets or frayed wires protruding from the wall, you should have the issues fixed by a trained electrician. If yours are overloaded with too many plugs, consider having a qualified electrician install additional outlets.</p>
<p>An SPD can damp the spike down to a value compatible with that which most connected appliances can withstand: approximately 1.5 kV. All devices within 10 meters of the switchboard are effectively protected. Even better, opt for a quality battery backup unit (#ad) instead of a surge protector. It might be possible, but it would require that each outlet have the same wires in it. A half hot requires two colored wires, usually black and red, but it could be two black wires.</p>

<p>Do not use water to extinguish an electrical fire. More than half of the 28,000 electrical home fires and nearly 70% of the 400 electrocutions that occur in the U.S. every year could have been prevented with two inexpensive, DIY-friendly safety devices: AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets.

These systems power the lights, appliances, and equipment that make people's lives and jobs easier and more comfortable. Electrical receptacles (also called electrical outlets or "plugs" or "sockets") are simple devices that are easy to install, but there are details to get right if you want to be safe.</p>

<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks.
