An automatic backup generator helps prevent problems like food spoilage and flooding by ensuring that your home's critical devices (such as the refrigerator and sump pump) maintain power. If you are experiencing frequently tripped circuit breakers, it may be time for a panel upgrade to allow for more electricity.</p>
<p>If the main is a breaker, the overload rating size is typically on the handle, or immediately adjacent, e.g. 200, 175, or 150 (Amps). With a generator, you'll never lose time or money due to a power outage again. Because electricity travels on the outside of copper wire, wires are insulated to protect against fire and shock. Leave one bare ground wire long, and snip the rest to 6 in. beyond the box. If a power line is broken stay as far away as possible to reduce the risk of electrical shock.</p>
<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur. It would be smart for the Licensed Electrician to take some Industrial Electrician courses too, but if time is of the essence, the electrician may want to get PLC Troubleshooting training first. And one licensed electrician for each trainee working a commercial or industrial jobsite.

These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>
