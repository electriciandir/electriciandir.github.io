<p>Home generators are most needed to provide backup power in times of electrical outage.

It is important to note that no matter the degree chosen, an apprenticeship will still be required to work as a licensed electrician.</p>
<p>If a 14-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 15 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be used to protect that circuit. This kind of generators is portable ones and is advantageous when you will use it for a short period of time. However, don't leave gas in the portable generator for long periods. Buy a larger transformer than you'll initially need so you can add lights later as your landscape (and imagination) expands.
