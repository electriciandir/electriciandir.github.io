<p>You might be working on a low-voltage application but live electrical circuits can still be pretty harmful especially when not used safely. Standby generators are sized by kilowatts (kW), which is a unit of power. Check the breaker that turns the circuit off; if it is a 20 amp breaker or fuse, you will need 12-3 wire (12 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground).
