Your home is full of electronic devices and appliances that depend on electricity.</p>
<p>Before installing a solar power system, homeowners must have their home evaluated by a licensed, qualified electrician to ensure the existing electrical system can support this new technology. Light fixtures are an integral part of any home. I'd bought a cut-in style, electrical switch box. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL3 is faulty.
