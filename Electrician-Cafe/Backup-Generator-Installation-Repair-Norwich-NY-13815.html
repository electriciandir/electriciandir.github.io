Here's some vital information to help ensure your safety around utility poles and power lines. But the low-voltage wiring on the low voltage secondary wiring that is operated by wall switches and used to control 120V devices may itself be un fused.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of electrocution and fires, the National Electrical Code requires specific types of outlets in certain locations. Most states require electricians to be licensed.
