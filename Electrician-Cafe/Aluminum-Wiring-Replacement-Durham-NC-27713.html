<p>Before applying for a license, electrical contractor companies must designate an employee as the electrician in responsible charge of electrical activities. At the end of the apprenticeship the apprentice is required to pass three examinations, one of which is theory based with the other two practically based. Consider installing a dedicated electrical sub-panel: In addition to the generator and transfer switch, you may want to invest in a dedicated electrical sub-panel, as well.</p>
<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights.
