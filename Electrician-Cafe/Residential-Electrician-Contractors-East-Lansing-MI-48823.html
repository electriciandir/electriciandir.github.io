It is strongly recommended that you consult a professional before attempting any lighting or wiring projects. Circuit breakers are designed to fit into the existing cubicle with little to no modification to the switchgear cell. Cord insulation keeps electricity in the wires, where it belongs. Knob & tube wiring does not provide a third wire for grounding and is therefore considered unsafe in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms and outdoors.</p>
<p>Sconces create the perfect lighting to surround a deck or porch.

<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords.
