If you have an older circuit breaker panel in your home, then you may find that it does not have enough amps to manage all of the items in your home. True, the intensity of a driveway solar light is not as bright as their low voltage counterpart, however cost of ownership, installation, and durability are superior to low-voltage electrical systems.</p>
