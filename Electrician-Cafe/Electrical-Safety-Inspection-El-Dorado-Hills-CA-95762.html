<p>Surge protection is a key concern at homes and offices since damages attributed to irregular voltage spikes can run into hundreds as well as thousands of dollars. Malfunctioning electric service can cause voltage drop on both Hot wires or either Hot wire. Turn the electricity back on and if it was the switch or outlet that was faulty, your light and outlet should work properly.

The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
