This will help shunt the surge caused by the appliances from the rest of the house, which will help reduce the risk of fire and possibly other electrical meltdowns. Southern Lights can make sure that your landscape lighting always looks spectacular and is checked on an ongoing basis to prevent problems. If you're seeing signs of bad wiring or other potential electrical safety issues, the trained electricians at AAA Service are here to help.

Investing in a whole-house generator means you will always have backup power should you need it.
