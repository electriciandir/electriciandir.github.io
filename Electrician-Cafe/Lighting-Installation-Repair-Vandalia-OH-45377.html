A licensed electrical technician can determine whether the wirings are no longer safe to use and if so, he can make the necessary replacements.</p>
<p>The key is to create a balance, highlighting a few spots and providing lighting transitions between them. By following these rules, your DIY low voltage system will be installed like a professional, and will provide you with a low-maintenance, hassle free 12V system for years to come.
