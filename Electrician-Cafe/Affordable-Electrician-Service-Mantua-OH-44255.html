<p>Need a Generator Installation? In times of emergencies, portable generators provide the most economical way of supplying back up power.

In the past, when low voltage tungsten bulbs were used, the fixtures where daisy- chained with no real attention paid to bulb brightness, color or longevity because tungsten bulbs can burn for years on very little voltage.</p>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
