<p>When buying a standby generator for your home, it is very important to choose the right sized generator. This is where you may decide what kinds of fixtures you would like to install and where. Some electricians start out by attending a technical school. Getting a propane-powered portable generator is a smarter solution. Fuses can pose an electrical fire hazard, and you may have trouble acquiring insurance for your home if you don't get them upgraded.
