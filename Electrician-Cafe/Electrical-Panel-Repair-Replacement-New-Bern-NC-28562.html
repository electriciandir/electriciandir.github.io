These are in fact, certainly good reasons to pick a diesel backup generator over one that works on gasoline. They provide uninterrupted backup power for days, unlike portable generators. Neither is it designed for field use by electrical tradesmen and inspectors for testing compliance with national wiring standards.</p>
