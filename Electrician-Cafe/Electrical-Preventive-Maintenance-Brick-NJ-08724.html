<p>Fuse Box Replacement vs Upgrade - If you have a fuse box, whether or not it is acting up, we strongly recommend an upgrade. The braided fabric wire insulation was found on a 1960's fluorescent light ballast, while the plastic wire was used in the branch circuit wiring for the light where that ballast was employed. These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>
