If you need service on the weekend, after normal office hours, or even on a holiday, the experts at Blind & Sons will provide solutions you can trust. If one-half of a duplex outlet is controlled by a wall switch, then the hot tab, and possibly the neutral tab, will be broken off.

Outdoor lighting brightens walkways and gives your home a safer, more welcoming appearance.</p>

AFCIs (arc-fault circuit interrupters) protect against fire by continuously monitoring the electrical current in a circuit and shutting off the circuit when unintended arcing occurs.</p>
<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
