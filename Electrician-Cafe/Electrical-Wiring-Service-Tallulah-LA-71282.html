<p>If you have already purchased solar lighting fixtures or low voltage lights, place them where you would like them. Never attempt to perform this job when the main power to the house is turned on.

<p>The method you choose will depend on the type of fixtures, the distance from the transformer, and the type and size of wire.

We can help you to reduce your utility expenses by installing energy efficient lights or solar lamps. Of course, t is essential that you have proper lighting during the night, especially in outdoor spaces and pathways.</p>

<p>For a light fixture such as a ceiling light, in addition to bringing power to the junction box where the light fixture is to be mounted (using 14-2 copper wire) we'd use a separate length of 14-2 wire to run from the light switch to the junction box to control the light. Our team at The Electric Connection is ready to help you design the perfect lighting scheme for your landscaping that will enhance the natural beauty as well as the safety of your outdoor space while adding value to your Los Angeles home.</p>

These spotlights are specially designed for use with trees. It is in this line of thought the surge protectors were invented.
