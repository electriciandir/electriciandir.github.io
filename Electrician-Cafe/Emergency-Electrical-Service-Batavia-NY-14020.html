<p>When lightning strikes near a building with no protection, it can travel inside via power lines directly connected to the switchboard. Many people are currently doing this improvement, because in the majority of homes, circuit breaker panels are usually 100 amp.

<p>There are a few smart light switches that don't require neutral wires, but they are cost-prohibitive and harder to come across. Your home and safety are too important to use a non licensed electrician. You pay a substantial price for the convenience of a permanently installed generator, and that price increases substantially as output goes up. It starts at about $3,000 for the 6- to 8-kw models and reaches from $5,000 to $10,000 for the 11- to 20-kw units. The variety of light fixtures and lighting accessories has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>

Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors.
