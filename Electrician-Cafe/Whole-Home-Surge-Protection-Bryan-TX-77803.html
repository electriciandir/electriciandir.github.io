<p>10. A dangerous condition where an individual could make an electrical contact with an energized equipment or a conductor which the person may sustain injury from it. There are many different types of electrical outlets, some of which are required for specific appliances. Transformers or power-packs are designed to plug into any 120vac house circuit and reduces the output voltage to 12vac which creates a low-voltage system.
