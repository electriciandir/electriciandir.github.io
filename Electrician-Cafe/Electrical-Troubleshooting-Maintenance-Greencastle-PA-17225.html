If the switch is grounded, remove the grounding wire last.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to suggest that more than half of the energy consumed worldwide is converted by AC motors into work and these are controlled by drives. As the best standby generator on our list, we like how it runs quietly but with power distribution and load shedding feature that lets its motor limit the power supplied to certain devices to keep it from overheating and to certain areas of your home to keep your appliances and electronics protected.</p>
