<p>In some instances, wiring colors are also applied in electrical wiring installation that does not adhere to the general rules of wiring. Information on the following pages includes important safety information and tips to follow for safely using electrical appliances and being safe around electricity. Residential electricity as an industry is fairly young; electrical systems have only been a standard installation in new homes since about 1930. Sometimes homeowners choose to upgrade service while doing another project, such as burying an overhead power line.</p>
<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot.
