This Briggs & Stratton standby generator is fitted with a commercial Vanguard engine that provides whole-house power to the tune of 20 kilowatts on liquid propane and 18 kilowatts on natural gas. Downed power lines can energize the ground up to 35 feet away. Unlike small standby generators that can only use natural gas or propane, whole home generators also have a diesel option which makes power more accessible.</p>

<p>For example, devices such as refrigerators and air conditioners require large amounts of energy to switch motors and compressors on and off, creating surges in power that disrupt the steady flow of voltage. A good rule of thumb is to treat all wires as if they're live, so first connect the ground wire, then neutral wire, then load, and lastly hot. Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months.

Alternatively, many home grade outlets have small holes in the rear of the outlet where the wires can be simply pushed in instead of wrapping around the screw.</p>
