<p>This is the comprehensive guide to all types of electrical switches and sockets that are commonly used in your home. Conduct generator maintenance and repairs as needed.

Leave one bare ground wire long, and snip the rest to 6 in. beyond the box. If a power line is broken stay as far away as possible to reduce the risk of electrical shock.</p>
<p>Check to see whether the outlet is switch-controlled and that the switch is on. Some outlets turn on or off via wall light switches.
