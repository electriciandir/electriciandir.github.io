<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>

<p>Backup generators are extremely common for houses and businesses alike that would need a source of power in case the main power cuts out.
