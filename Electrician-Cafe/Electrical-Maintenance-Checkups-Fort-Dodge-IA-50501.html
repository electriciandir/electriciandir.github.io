If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages.

<p>You should contact an expert immediately if you have an obsolete electrical panel (for example, older Zinsco electrical panels ) or your panel no longer works effectively. All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification. NIST reports that "Sending them surges down the drain of a grounding conductor only makes them reappear within a microsecond about 200 meters away on some other conductor." 35 So having protection on a data transmission line is only required if surges are diverted to the ground line.</p>
