<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone.

<p>But there are a few things that electricians will not do. Most portable units run on gas or propane. Sizzling noises in the switch means that it is time to have it looked at.

Standby generators should be started up once a week and run for 15 minutes to "exercise" them - making sure they're ready when needed.</p>
<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
