<p>It is important to plan ahead when installing low voltage lighting so that you can avoid any potential problems, especially with the setup. Tell children that electric cords should be left alone.

Standby generators should be started up once a week and run for 15 minutes to "exercise" them - making sure they're ready when needed.</p>
<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities.
