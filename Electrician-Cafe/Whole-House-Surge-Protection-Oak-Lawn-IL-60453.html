After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
