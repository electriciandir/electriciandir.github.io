The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation.

<p>Portable generators must run outdoors. You don't need to stumble around in the dark, rain or bad weather to pull the starter cord on your standby generator, as you do with a portable.

If you smell something fishy (literally), it could be a burning electrical outlet, switch, or other device. The neutral wire in the new switch box is capped with a wire nut unless it's needed for a smart switch or timer. As you add electrical wiring, you'll need another switch to control that part of the home.

Another service that is offered is the yearly maintenance of the heating and cooling systems that generally involves the checking of the various components of the system. A common error is pouring water on electrical fires. There's no need to do anything unusual for LED lighting, advises Thomas Stone.
