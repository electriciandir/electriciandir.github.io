<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Alfred</h2>

Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>
