This kind of generators is portable ones and is advantageous when you will use it for a short period of time. However, don't leave gas in the portable generator for long periods. Buy a larger transformer than you'll initially need so you can add lights later as your landscape (and imagination) expands. Education: Industrial electricians must obtain a high school diploma, engage in an apprenticeship program, attend classes, 8,000-10,000 hours of on-the-job experience and the pass a competency exam.</p>

Some landscape lighting systems operate on "line voltage," the 120-volt current from your house. AMP® fixtures are built to last as long as the LEDs they house.
