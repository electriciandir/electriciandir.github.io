A system can be configured with floodlights placed high in either corner of the yard or on corners of the house to keep the property safe. In the past, when low voltage tungsten bulbs were used, the fixtures where daisy- chained with no real attention paid to bulb brightness, color or longevity because tungsten bulbs can burn for years on very little voltage.</p>
<p>The application of LED's as landscape lighting fixtures was realized in the later half of the 20th century as more and more people focused in furthering lawn improvements and finding new ways to enhancing landscape designs with lights that would not pose much risk and at the same time would cut the operational cost over time.
