Finally, as with all electrical or mechanical devices, wear and tear, age and the effects of the elements can create damage that requires repair or replacement. For some houses, an upgrade to copper electrical wiring may be necessary. Therefore if your "plug" (wall receptacle) is not working, the green screw and ground wire are not the problem.</p>

Breaker and fuse box panels are complicated and delicate pieces of equipment. Some prefer to have slightly brighter lights that allow them to see their entire yard, this gives them a sense of security; others prefer a much more subdued light that creates an ambience rather than a light show. An automatic backup generator turns on within seconds of the power going out, and when the return of utility power is sensed, it automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode, ready for the next outage.</p>
<p>Transformers usually have a recommended gauge of wire to use with their system based on the amount of power the transformer can tolerate. With good lighting, you will be providing your visitors with the ability to see their way through your yard, without running the risk of them hurting themselves.
