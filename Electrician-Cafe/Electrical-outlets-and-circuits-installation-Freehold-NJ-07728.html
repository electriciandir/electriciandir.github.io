Ambient light is often found in the form of recessed lighting or other types of ceiling lights. A light switch is inexpensive and has small parts entirely contained inside a plastic casing, so if the switch is bad the best option is to replace it. But before you replace it you need to determine whether it is the light switch that is faulty or if the wiring is the problem.</p>
