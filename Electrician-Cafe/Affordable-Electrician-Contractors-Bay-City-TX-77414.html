The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.

If you want to have standby backup power for your entire house, you are going to need almost double the largest size to power most homes completely. Due to an ever-increasing requirement for improving energy conservation efforts and the importance that this initiative will have on our future and well-being, it makes sense that by using these lower voltage lights and saving more energy that you can also take part in helping with the conservation goals needed to prevent using up our valuable energy resources or to continue rapidly depleting them.</p>
