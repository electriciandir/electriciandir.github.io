<p>I'm not sure if you're aware of the fact that inside your home are a lot of sensitive electronics. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC. An electrician working on a commercial or industrial building must be able to correctly size loads.</p>
<p>Before installing a solar power system, homeowners must have their home evaluated by a licensed, qualified electrician to ensure the existing electrical system can support this new technology. Light fixtures are an integral part of any home. I'd bought a cut-in style, electrical switch box. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL3 is faulty.
