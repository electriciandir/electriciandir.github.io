Master - As a master electrician, you could work as a foreman or team leader supervising journeyman and apprentice electricians. A merger between Charles Coffin's Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company in 1892 led to the creation of GE.

The number, color, and function of the wires at an outlet can be confusing if the original connections are lost track of.
