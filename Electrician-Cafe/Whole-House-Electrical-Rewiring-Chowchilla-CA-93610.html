<p>Important thing to remember - if you decide to install GFCI receptacle in a place of the existing electrical outlet, you should perform this installation following your current local jurisdiction requirements - this might not be entirely the latest NEC (National Electrical Code) but should be very close to it - find out required GFCI locations based on the latest NEC.
