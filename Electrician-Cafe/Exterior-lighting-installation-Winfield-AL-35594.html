<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers. If your certificate is more than 90 days past the expiration date, you must reapply and take the master electrical examination to reinstate your certificate.</p>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems.

We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
