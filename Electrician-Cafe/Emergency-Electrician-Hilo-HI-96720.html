Over heated circuits and loose connections are the most common cause of electrical fires.</p>

Ensure that near overhead power lines, your children don't climb trees or fly kites. Installation pricing is also dependent on your choice of chandelier, materials needed for upgrades including extra wiring and the electrician's time.</p>
