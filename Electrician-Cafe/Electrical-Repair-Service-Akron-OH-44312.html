Splice into the permanently hot wire, putting it to the second switch. Always assume that power lines, even if they have come down, carry an electrical charge. Many devices use wall warts - plugs that convert AC power into DC power and look like little boxes with electrical prongs sticking out. When it comes to natural gas, as long as you have it coming to your property, there is no reason why you shouldn't be using a generator powered by it.

NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>

<p>11 18 19 The first six methods listed operate primarily by diverting unwanted surge energy away from the protected load, through a protective component connected in a parallel (or shunted) topology.
