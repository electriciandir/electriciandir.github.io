<p>The disruption of power for substantial lengths of time can occur at any time due to hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, snowfall and other natural calamities. You do not need to be an expert contractor to install your lighting system. And surge protection plays a more important role than ever before. Portable generators must be at least 15 feet away from your home. Only a licensed and experienced electrician should perform major electrical projects such as an upgrade and rewiring of the home. First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied‚Äù with their purchase.</p>
