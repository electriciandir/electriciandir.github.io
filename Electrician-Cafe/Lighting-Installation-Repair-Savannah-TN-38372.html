<p>When you need to upgrade your lighting to modern, energy efficient LEDs, we want you to stay in the loop. If you have a large property or a complex lighting design, the unusually long runs of wire to the transformer may lose voltage — called voltage drop” — so a larger transformer is required to keep all lights on the same circuit.

<p>The safety of the system depends first on how well you have maintained the safety valves — your electrical fuses or your circuit breakers. Children and pets have inquisitive, adventurous natures, but unfortunately aren't yet up to speed with electrical safety, making them prime targets for injuries and shocks. If the panel gives off a burning smell, this could be a sign that either there is a bad circuit breaker or that a wire isn't properly connected. An aging or damaged electric panel in your home is ineffective and a potential safety hazard.</p>

The switch from fuses to breakers may also signal a replacement in your wiring and insulation.
