Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>

Lutron and Touch-Plate offer upgraded systems that would allow you to continue to use your home's wiring, but would require new panels, relays, light switches, and other adaptations. Pigtail wires will require the use of silicone-filled wire nuts for connections.
