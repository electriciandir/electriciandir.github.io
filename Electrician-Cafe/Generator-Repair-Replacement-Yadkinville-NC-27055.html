Or it can happen if someone in a nearby factory switches on or off a huge appliance with a powerful electric motor inside it, which might cause a sudden surge or drop in power in the whole circuit in your home.</p>

Yago recommends running your portable generator for about a half hour every few months.

Use power boards with in-built safety devices to avoid a power outlet overload.
