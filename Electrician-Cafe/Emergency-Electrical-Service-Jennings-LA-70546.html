<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Contractor in Jennings</h2>
<p>If you want to protect your electronic equipment from sudden damage or failure, then you may want to consider using a surge protector. You will need to bend or break off one of the new electrical box tabs in the back to run the wire through.

Whole house generator installation costs for electrical contractors range from $60-$100 per hour to wire the generator to the electrical panel plus the cost of wire and additional supplies. However, there's one thing wrapped in plastic sheaths or hidden behind walls that can also affect the safety of your home-it's electrical wiring.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house.
