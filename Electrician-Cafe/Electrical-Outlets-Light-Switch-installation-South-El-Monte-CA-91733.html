If you are asking about using a shared neutral wire on a lighting circuit combined with an electrical receptacle circuit, see (search for) our article on "multi wire branch circuits" or "shared neutral electrical wiring".

Your circuit breaker should be labeled and diagrammed somewhere in the service panel, most often inside the cover lid. Even the most effective surge protectors can not protect equipment from the sudden increase in electrical pressure of millions of volts that lightning can supply. A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
