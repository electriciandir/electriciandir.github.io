If you are asking about using a shared neutral wire on a lighting circuit combined with an electrical receptacle circuit, see (search for) our article on "multi wire branch circuits" or "shared neutral electrical wiring". Contactor assemblies are frequently made with main contacts that serve to connect and disconnect the main power circuit and any auxiliary contacts (both normally open and normally closed) that operate with the main contacts.</p>
<p>If the maintenance person does not troubleshoot the circuit prior to replacing the fuse and restoring power, negative consequences could arise. Your circuit breaker should be labeled and diagrammed somewhere in the service panel, most often inside the cover lid. Even the most effective surge protectors can not protect equipment from the sudden increase in electrical pressure of millions of volts that lightning can supply. A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
