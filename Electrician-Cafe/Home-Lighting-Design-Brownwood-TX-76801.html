<p>Electricity flows in through your electrical meter before reaching the circuit breaker panel where it is then routed for distribution among the various rooms of your home.

<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
<p>Carry an apprentice license for 8000 hours, pass the Journeyman test and hold that license for another 4000 hours and then pass the master license.
