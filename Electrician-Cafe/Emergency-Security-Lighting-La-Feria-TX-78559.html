Be wary of items purchased outside or imported into the UK, as these don't always meet national safety standards, and definitely avoid counterfeit electrical goods (such as off-brand hair straighteners), which are the leading cause of electrical shocks and fires. Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
