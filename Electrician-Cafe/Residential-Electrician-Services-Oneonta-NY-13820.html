If not, then the light switch will simply turn off the whole outlet, as well as the entire circuit following that outlet.</p>
<p>Apprentices work under the direct supervision of licensed journey worker electricians. They will help you to decide whether you should have your outdated fuse or breaker panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker Panel.
