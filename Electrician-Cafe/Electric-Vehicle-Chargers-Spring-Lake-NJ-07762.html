There's no way to know how much protection a device has left, or if the initial rating is even accurate. We purchased a Generac full house generator from Kegley Electric.</p>
<p>A power surge, or transient voltage, is an increase in voltage significantly above the intended level in a flow of electricity. It is also advisable to install dimmer lights in such cases.
