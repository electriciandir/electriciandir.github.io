<p>It's not worth risking the safety of your crew or the home owners by working with inexperienced, unlicensed electricians or electrical construction teams. If the breaker stays on, try the light switch to assure the fixture lights properly. Main lug panels have a separate shut-off system, which could be near the meter or connected to the main panel's breaker. A licensed electrical technician can determine whether the wirings are no longer safe to use and if so, he can make the necessary replacements.</p>
<p>Make sure all 3-wired tools and appliances with flexible cords are properly grounded. There are some wiring systems out there that are actually better at conducting and are more efficient like fiber optics, but because of its wide availability copper wire still remains king. A good electrician has the required knowledge and experience to deal with electrical complications and therefore he is likely to be able to analyze the situation better and handle it accordingly.</p>
