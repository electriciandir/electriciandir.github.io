Now use a square-blade shovel to cut a 2- to 3-inch-deep trench along the line where you want the light fixtures. Condition of existing wiring and fixtures. However, if you experience frequent breaker trips or dimming lights, it may mean your electrical panel can't handle the load and is due for an upgrade.

Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.
