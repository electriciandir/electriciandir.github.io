Some electricians work on-call and put in extra hours to troubleshoot urgent problems. Our electricians are experienced, skilled, and licensed for all types of electrical work in your home. Your home's electrical system is comprised of many different parts, including incoming power lines or conduit, an electric meter, service panels and subpanels, household wiring, electrical outlets, switches, and the appliances that use this power.</p>
