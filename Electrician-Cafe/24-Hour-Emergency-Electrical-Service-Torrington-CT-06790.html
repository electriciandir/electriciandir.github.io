Most likely you don't live in an area of the world where the sun rises and sets at the same time each day, so I recommend buying a transformer that has a photocell light sensor, the light sensor turns your outdoor lighting on at dusk and then it should have some sort of control so you can adjust how long the lights will stay on for.</p>

Your circuit breaker panel is truly the hub of your electrical system, and you can't get by without one. You can improve how the trees, fountains, and others look by highlighting your property.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, outdoor lighting can also enhance private landscape areas for you to enjoy. There will also be one large switch, usually at the top of the panel; this is the main circuit breaker, and it controls power flow to the entire electric panel.
