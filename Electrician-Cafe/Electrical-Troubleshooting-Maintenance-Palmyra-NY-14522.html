<p>Need a Generator Installation? In times of emergencies, portable generators provide the most economical way of supplying back up power. The lower wattage of LED lamp fixtures provides improved performance for a mere fraction of the energy use of other lighting. There is no project too big or too small for the Rawhide Electrical Services team. If there is a light, the blue wire should be connected to the black wire of the switch as well. However, if you want a different generator that is only intended for home use, then you can opt for standby generators.</p>

Tracing electrical wiring in walls can be tricky, and it involves more than just looking for the wires themselves.

The black wire is the "hot" wire, which carries the electricity from the breaker panel into the switch or light source.</p>
