For example, in New Jersey, contractor licenses are issued to firms or individuals who can show proof of at least five years of practical experience in electrical construction and installation and pass a written examination. Emergencies can happen at any time of the day, and when you need an urgent repair for your egress lighting, your safety and your occupants' safety shouldn't be left on hold.</p>
