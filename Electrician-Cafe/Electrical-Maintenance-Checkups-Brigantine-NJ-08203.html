With a more reliable, high capacity electrical panel, we can ensure that your system is up to code and put important safeguards into place. And you don't change the colors because the outlet is mounted in what most would consider "upside-down"; the black wires always go to the brass screws, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>Always get the advice of a qualified electrician to see if your panel can be saved before deciding to get an electric panel replacement. Similarly, generators can handle higher electrical loads for short amounts of time, and the surge watts” measurement defines the limit of this ability. The first variable-speed home standby generator, the Generac Synergy varies its speed based upon electrical load, for quieter operation, improved fuel-efficiency, and exceptionally clean power output.</p>
