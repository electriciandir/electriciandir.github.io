<p>The outlet has a circuit breaker incorporated into the outlet which trips if too much current is drawn or if a short occurs because of moisture.

From commercial generators to the generator you may use for your RV or travel trailer, our team can help get your generator back into working order. Generators produce AC voltage, very similar to the voltage available in your home, however while your electric utility company produces sufficient power for all your electric powered devices, a home standby generator is limited in power output directly related to the engine horsepower.</p>

Check out our wide range of residential electrical services to see what we have to offer.

<p>Common emergency repairs we see consist of GFI ground fault issues, breaker repairs after a lightning storm and outlet repairs due to circuit problems. When the electricity arcs (jumps, or "arcs") from an exposed energized conductor or circuit part (e.g., overhead power lines) through a gas (such as air) to a person who is grounded (that would provide an alternative route to the ground for the electrical current). Damaged service cables running from the structural mount on your building to the breaker panel should be handled by an electrician.</p>
<p>Electricity flows in through your electrical meter before reaching the circuit breaker panel where it is then routed for distribution among the various rooms of your home. And unless you buy a large generator (they're available with more than 15,000 watts), you're still limited in what you can power. Keep yourself and any equipment at least 10 feet away from power lines. Given that, you must turn off the circuit breaker before you start any electrical job. When you have an electrical emergency and can't afford to wait, you need professional help immediately from an emergency electrician.</p>

Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't. When it detects an interruption in your main utility service, it safely switches you from that power source to the standby generator's power.
