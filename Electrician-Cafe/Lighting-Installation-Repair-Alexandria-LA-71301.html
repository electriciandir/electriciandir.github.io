<p>Surge protectors more commonly protect equipment from lower-voltage surges that occur frequently in modern electrical wiring. The total amperage of the branch circuit breakers serving the house should not exceed the amperage of the panel. As you see in the photo above, typically aluminum electrical branch circuit wiring was plastic-covered. Line voltage lighting include table lamps and most ceiling fixtures.
