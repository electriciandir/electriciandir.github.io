<h2>Electrical Panel Upgrades Huntsville Alabama</h2>
<p>If the light switch is in the on position, and you touch the wrong parts of the light bulb, while removing and replacing it, you could find yourself getting a nice jolt of electricity through your body. If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>
<p>It's often also called the main breaker box, the fuse box, a distribution panel, a load center and even a breaker panel.

<h3>Creative New Home Electrical Ideas Huntsville AL 35810</h3>
<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>
<p>Heavy-duty (220v, 240v, 250v): this refers to outlets that are designed for devices that draw a lot of power, such as refrigerators, dryers, and ovens. With our staff of master electricians, we can solve any electrical issue in your home with a professionalism you won't find elsewhere.
