<p>Since short circuits have such damaging impacts on electrical equipment, their impact on the components in the circuit must be purpose of this course is to explain how the various protective devices react to faulted conditions and how to select the appropriate devices to ensure proper coordination. In fact they report that it makes up more than 25% of the approximately 81,000 electrical system fires that occur each year. This form of older wiring creates a risk of faults and fires, and often can't handle the electrical load of modern houses.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
