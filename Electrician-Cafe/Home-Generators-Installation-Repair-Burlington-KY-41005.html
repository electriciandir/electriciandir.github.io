<p>Until recently the standards and regulation surrounding the electrical wiring and installation in the UK varied greatly from other European countries. If you are considering replacing your fuse box with a circuit breaker, it is important to weigh each option carefully and speak with a qualified electrician. In 1901, a group of electrical contractors met at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, NY, where a major display of electric power had been installed.
