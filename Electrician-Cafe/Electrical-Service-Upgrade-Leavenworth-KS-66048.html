One half of the outlet should be on at all times, with the wall switch controlling the other half. Complete one year of formal training and work under a journeyman electrician for hands-on training.</p>

Licenses and other communications from the Electricians' Examining Board will be sent to you by email, so please be sure to keep your contact information current. Our electricians always let our customer know what they are going to do - before star working on repairing.</p>
