<p>Water conducts electricity, so even the slightest exposure to this dangerous mix can lead to injury. Armored cables with two rubber-insulated conductors in a flexible metal sheath were used as early as 1906, and were considered at the time a better method than open knob-and-tube wiring, although much more expensive. We perform panel upgrades, service and maintenance, to ensure safe, functional service at all times. Journeyman License: Licences are issued by municipality agencies.</p>
<p>Make sure all 3-wired tools and appliances with flexible cords are properly grounded. There are some wiring systems out there that are actually better at conducting and are more efficient like fiber optics, but because of its wide availability copper wire still remains king.

<p>Our electricians know that the value of having continuous backup power if utility supply should fail is nearly incalculable.
