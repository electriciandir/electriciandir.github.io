<p>An electrical surge is the equivalent to all of a sudden having extra blood and it bursting through your body, damaging all of the sensitive veins and capillaries. Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle. A panel upgrade involves changing the electric panel equipment serving your home or business.</p>
<p>Surge protectors more commonly protect equipment from lower-voltage surges that occur frequently in modern electrical wiring. The total amperage of the branch circuit breakers serving the house should not exceed the amperage of the panel.
