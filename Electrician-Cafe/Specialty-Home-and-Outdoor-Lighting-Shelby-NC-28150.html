First, though portable generators are cheaper, they do have their issues: In the Consumer Reports survey, 22% of people who had portable generators ran out of fuel, 10% said the generator didn't power what they needed it to, and 9% said it didn't start at all; meanwhile, nearly nine in 10 consumers with standby generators were highly satisfied” with their purchase.</p>

Surge suppressors, as they are also called, regulate voltage being supplied to an electrical device. Portable generators usually offer between 2 and 8 kilowatts; 4 to 6 kW is usually enough to power a home's essential appliances, like lights and a portable heater, says Yago. Check with your salesperson when buying the transformer if it will do the job for the number of lights you plan to use.</p>
