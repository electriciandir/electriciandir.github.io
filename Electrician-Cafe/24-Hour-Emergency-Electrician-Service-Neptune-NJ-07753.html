<p>An electrical surge is the equivalent to all of a sudden having extra blood and it bursting through your body, damaging all of the sensitive veins and capillaries. Walk through the house and make a list of everything you want to power during an outage. Both of these numbers must be calculated: running watts represent the power consumed by an electrical motor while running normally, and starting KVA is required because each time an electrical motor starts up, there's an extra electrical surge that the generator must be able to handle.
