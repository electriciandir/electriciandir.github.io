<p>Having a backup power generator is a necessity for emergency services that have to keep working even if the power goes out. The white wire from the switch to the receptacle would have been rewired to be used as a neutral.

It is vital that safety equipment is regularly tested as even non-conductive materials, such as rubber, wood, or plastic, can conduct electricity if damp, dirty, or damaged.</p>
