<p>Ag-Pro Companies is the Premiere Plus Dealer of Generac Generators. TIP: It is a good practice to wrap the outlet terminals with electrical tape to prevent them from making contact with other wires or the electrical box itself if it is metal. Before going to sleep or heading out, make it a habit of confirming that all electrical appliances, such as game consoles, TVs and kitchen appliances, that are not in use are properly turned off. One increasingly popular option is to purchase a standby generator , also known as a whole-house generator.</p>
<p>Our plumbers, electricians, and HVAC technicians are some of the highest trained professionals in the industry. The proliferation of wireless handheld devices that charge at lower voltages make surge protection more important than ever. Enclosure - Because standby generators usually are installed outdoors, they need to be made of a hardwearing material that can bear up to harsh weather, environmental damage, and many years of use.

<p>Journeyman License: At least 4 years (8,000 hours) of apprentice experience, as well as 576 hours of training, are required. If you are planning on wiring a light switch in your home you need to have a basic understanding of how electricity works and how the current travels around the house together with the various components in the circuits.
