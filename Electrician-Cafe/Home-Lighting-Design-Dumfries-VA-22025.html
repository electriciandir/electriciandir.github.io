Propane tanks don't need power to be refilled, vs gas that required electric pumps.

Electrical surges caused by such unexpected and unpreventable events as lightning or power fluxes at the local power plant can trigger rapid and dangerous increases in the power traveling into your home and to your computer through data and utility lines.</p>

We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule. Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless.

Wiring may be required if the receptacle needs to be installed from scratch or if the electrician determines that a circuit needs to be extended.</p>
<p>Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets. I keep the portable for when I do outside work at the back of our property (1+ acre) where running an extension to the house when using the electric trimmer doesn't work well due to the voltage drop.</p>
<h3>Why Surge Protectors Are So Important in Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>When you need to upgrade your lighting to modern, energy efficient LEDs, we want you to stay in the loop. If you have a large property or a complex lighting design, the unusually long runs of wire to the transformer may lose voltage — called voltage drop” — so a larger transformer is required to keep all lights on the same circuit. We were out of power at our old farmhouse for 13 days back in 2008, we borrowed a generator to run a few items in our office.</p>

A leader in the Commercial, Residential & Industrial Electrical Contracting service. The electrical panel remains one of the most essential components of the house. If you have a screwdriver, voltage tester, insulated pliers and a wire connector you can troubleshoot your light switch to determine the problem and, if necessary, replace the switch.</p>
<p>Consult an electrician to learn whether your home's panel is still capable of providing the electricity you need or whether it's time to consider an upgrade. As a general rule houses are not supplied with enough power sockets or switches for additional lighting. Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>
