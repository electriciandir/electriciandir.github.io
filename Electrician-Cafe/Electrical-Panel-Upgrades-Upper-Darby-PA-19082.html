Generator repair is just as important as initial installation. These minor surges might occur from things like fan motors or other large power drain devices turning on and off frequently.

<p>The fixtures will be 95% if not 100% led.

<p>You must hold a valid electrical license or be an electrical journeyman or trainee while employed or supervised by a licensed electrician to perform any installation, maintenance, alteration, or repair on any electrical equipment within the City of Lafayette.

<p>Transformer - an electrical power source; this device is required to operate any low voltage fixture, in this case 12-volts.

If so, this could indicate that your electrical panel is defective, it was properly installed or it is overloaded — all of which indicate the need for an electrical upgrade. See how you could save on your next repair or installation with our special offers. Like every other piece of technology, the fuse panel has been upgraded with modern advances over time.</p>
<p>The installation went very smoothly and took less time than I had anticipated. If this occurs, check the wiring and circuit breaker and contact an electrician. In Florida, the current minimum amperage for an electrical panel is a 100 amp service but many older homes do not even have this capacity. For lights, turn the light switch on and off to be sure. In some instances, such as some switch legs, the function of the wires will be indicated by colored electrical tape.</p>
