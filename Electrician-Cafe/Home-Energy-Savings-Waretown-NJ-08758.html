<p>Surge protection is a key concern at homes and offices since damages attributed to irregular voltage spikes can run into hundreds as well as thousands of dollars. Malfunctioning electric service can cause voltage drop on both Hot wires or either Hot wire.

<p>Do not use water to extinguish an electrical fire. More than half of the 28,000 electrical home fires and nearly 70% of the 400 electrocutions that occur in the U.S. every year could have been prevented with two inexpensive, DIY-friendly safety devices: AFCI (Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets.
