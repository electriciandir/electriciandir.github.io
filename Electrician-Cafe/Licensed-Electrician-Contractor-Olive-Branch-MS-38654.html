I would definitely recommend a generator that either runs on propane or natural gas as those fuels do not degrade over time as gasoline does. Our staff is highly trained and prepared to handle virtually any kind of electrical emergency and will respond day or night. Electrical Contractor License: Only a licensed master electrician or a company that employs one can apply for it.</p>

Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis.
