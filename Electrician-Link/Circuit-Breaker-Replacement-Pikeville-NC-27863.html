<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Pikeville</h2>
<p>If you're like the average person, you use your computer a lot. Electricians read blueprints, which are technical diagrams of electrical systems that show the location of circuits, outlets, and other equipment. Since the transformer is plugged in, the fixture should light up, confirming the connection is good. Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the two screws holding the outlet in the box.
