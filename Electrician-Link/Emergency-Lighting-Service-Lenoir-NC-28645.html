And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors.

Don't remove the screws - it's not necessary, they are deliberately hard to remove completely, and they could be needed in some future wiring change.</p>

Maintenance can be performed by skilled installers rather than licensed electricians, whereas for traditional lighting systems a trained electrician is the safe choice.
