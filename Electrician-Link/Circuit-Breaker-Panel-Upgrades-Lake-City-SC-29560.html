<p>Most people know that surge suppression protects sensitive electronics, but they would struggle to explain why it's necessary. Two great experiences in a row with TLC - great service and quick resolutions to our issues. For controlling the low-voltage-operated switching relays that in turn operate 120V devices in buildings (lights, receptacles), very thin copper wires, typically #22 gauge, is used to connect the low-voltage switches to the relays that each switch controls.
