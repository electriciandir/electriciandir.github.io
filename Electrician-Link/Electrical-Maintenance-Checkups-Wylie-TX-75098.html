Lighting installation involves fitting new light devices like bulbs, lamps, and switches to your rooms, along with running new wires and connecting them to your circuit breaker. Fold the ground wires neatly into the back of the box (Photo 11). Depending on when the wiring was done, there may be completely different colors for your wires. Manually operated transformers require the lights to be turned on and off by hand.</p>
