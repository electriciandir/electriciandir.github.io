<p>A battery backup surge protector is the perfect solution for the persistent threat of power outages and data loss.

It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as Â£10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety).

As always take any advise with a grain of salt and read the instructions that came with the light fixtures and through the salt over your left shoulder.</p>
