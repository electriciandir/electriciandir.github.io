Time - Your electrician's time is usually the most expensive component of any bill. This would really help me avoid electrical fires or overloading a circuit. The unit is heavy and the installation is costly. The generator package comes with an automatic transfer switch that can handle quick and seamless transfer during a power outage with computer-controlled load management.</p>
<p>In North American practice, an overhead cable from a transformer on a power pole to a residential electrical service usually consists of three twisted (triplexed) conductors, with one being a bare neutral conductor, with the other two being the insulated conductors for both of the two 180-degree out of phase 120 V line voltages normally supplied. When you wire the new outlet only hook up the "hot" wire to the outlet, not the switched wire. Older wire could be aluminum or copper-clad aluminum.</p>
