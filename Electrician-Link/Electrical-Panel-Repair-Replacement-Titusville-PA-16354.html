If you don't have a 220-volt service, the electric company will have to run a new line into your home, and an electrician will need to replace your circuit box and possibly all your internal wiring as well, particularly if it uses outdated technology like aluminum wires or knob and tube. This is facilitated only if you want to install low voltage cable lighting outdoors. There's no shame in getting someone else to do the actual wiring for you if you lack the skill or knowledge to do so.
