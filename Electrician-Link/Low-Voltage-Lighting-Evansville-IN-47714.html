Uplighting is a landscape lighting technique that illuminates an area, surface or object from below to create a focal point in the landscape.</p>
<p>Finally, choose lighting that is low voltage. Wrapping the wire clockwise when wiring a light switch ensures that the loop on the end of the wire will tend to close when the screw is tightened. If you're looking to illuminate and decorate your entire yard, landscape lighting kits are a quick and easy way to light up a large area and can help tie together the decor.
