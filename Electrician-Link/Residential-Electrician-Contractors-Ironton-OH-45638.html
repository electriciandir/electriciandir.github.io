<p>Consumers like me and you are finding it more difficult to meet the daily living costs like gas and electricity which in turn is spurring demand for more affordable and cleaner alternative or renewable energies like solar power generators and system alike. Moisture penetrates the plastic connectors and corrodes the wires and cause a poor connection or worst, high resistance in the wires causing the transformer to overheat and eventually burn out the transformer.
