Moisture penetrates the plastic connectors and corrodes the wires and cause a poor connection or worst, high resistance in the wires causing the transformer to overheat and eventually burn out the transformer. If you want to learn to be a residential electrician, you will need a high school diploma or a G.E.D. It's helpful to take math, science and shop classes in high school.

Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
