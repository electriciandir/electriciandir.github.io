When that "other" switch is used to turn lights off, it was "down" and is now switched "up".</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel. Water - Before using an extension cord outside or in a wet area, confirm that the cord is rated for outdoor use and make sure the cord is connected to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
