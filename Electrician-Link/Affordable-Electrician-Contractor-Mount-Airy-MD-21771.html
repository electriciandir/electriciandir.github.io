<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>

<h2>Electrical Service Upgrade Mount Airy Maryland</h2>
<p>If your electrical panel is very old and not designed to handle the electrical usage that is currently taking place, you may be facing a serious fire hazard. Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed. An electrical contractor is permitted to apply for a permit from the local governmental jurisdiction to engage in electrical wiring at a specific job site.

All outdoor outlets should have waterproof covers.</p>
