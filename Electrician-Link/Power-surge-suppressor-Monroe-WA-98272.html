Though they work in different ways, they all protect the user against accidental electric shock and electrocution by acting immediately to shut off power to the appliance upon the detection of a leak” of electric current as may happen when a hair dryer falls into a sink full of water. Journeyman License: Most municipalities require licensing but requirements depend on your location.</p>
<p>As briefly explained above, the black wires are the power (or hot”) wires and the white wires are the neutral (or return”) wires. Someone turns the lights ON at switch #1. Attach the positive wire from the transformer to the low-voltage light's positive wire and the neutral wire to the the light's neutral with twist-on wire connectors.

Amazingly, most solar lights are able to last a very long time on the light they receive from the sun each day.

But allow the electrician to do all of the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>
