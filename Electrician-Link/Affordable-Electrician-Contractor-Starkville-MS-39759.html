Before choosing a generator, particularly standby generators, you'll need to decide what equipment you want it to run. Whether you want an electrical panel upgrade or you need repair, we're ready to help. But for a permanent hard-wire installation, more precautions must be made to be Class 2 compliant. When you call Penny Electric after hours, you will always be connected with a live representative who will immediately dispatch an emergency electrician or crew to your business location in Henderson or Las Vegas.</p>
