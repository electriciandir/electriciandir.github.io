<p>Many homeowners cannot afford to ride out a power outage without generator services. We also have certificates showing successful completion of safety training that teaches recognition of electrical safety hazards and how to avoid them. Use extension cords sparingly and check them periodically. Other firms applying for an electrical contractor's registration must employ a licensed master electrician in a supervisory capacity. In any home built before 1985, electrical wiring could be old and outdated. 2. Energy - This is a rating that tells you how much energy the surge protector can absorb before it burns out.</p>
<p>Repairing your generator is often a much more affordable option then completely replacing it, so if you have a generator that is not working correctly or is simply broken, be sure to call Guin Service.
