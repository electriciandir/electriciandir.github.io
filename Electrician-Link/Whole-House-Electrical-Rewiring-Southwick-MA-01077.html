<h2>How To Hire Emergency Electrician Service in Southwick</h2>
<p>There are a lot of causes for a power outage. Electric motors use more power to start than they do to run, which means electronic appliances with significant moving parts - such as fans, pumps, compressors on refrigerators, and air conditions - can use up to three times as more electricity to start as they do to run continuously. According to industry testing standards, based on IEEE and ANSI assumptions, power line surges inside a building can be up to 6,000 volts and 3,000 amperes, and deliver up to 90 joules of energy, including surges from external sources not including lightning strikes.</p>
<p>Diesel is a popular choice of fuel for larger, commercial generators. They can often take far more than what they are rated to handle and have been the staple of power protection for years. Let us start with the initial note as to what is lightning and why lightning protection is so important. Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
<p>Or you must have an accredited BS degree in electrical engineering, plus have one year of licensed experience.

<p>If the duration of the increase is longer than three nanoseconds (billionths of a second) it is referred to as a "surge," if the duration is less than that, then it is considered a "spike." A surge can cause significant damage to electronic equipment (particularly computers and modern multimedia systems).

Make sure that you check the age of your electrical panel in your home and consider a circuit panel replacement if your system is 25 years old or older.
