Such a system could run that same 3,000-square-foot house with about 20kW, cutting power to nonessential circuits as necessary.

Depending on the age of your home and its current wiring system, it may be time to upgrade from a fuse box to a breaker box to avoid damage to your home or electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Moreover, frequent power surges of a lower intensity, while usually undetected and seldom strong enough to cause immediate damage, can, over time, degrade the performance and decrease the lifespan of your computer. Remember that with simple power management‚Äù techniques, a small generator can provide adequate power for home or recreational applications. Improperly used extension cords, faulty or damaged wiring, and poorly insulated wires can lead to electrical fires.</p>
