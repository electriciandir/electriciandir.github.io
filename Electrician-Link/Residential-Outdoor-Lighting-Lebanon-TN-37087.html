<h2>How To Hire Residential Electrician Service in Lebanon</h2>

You'll also want to keep in mind that the 8000 watt rating is only in effect when using propane, if you tap into the natural gas you're looking at a maximum rating of 6000 watts. It comes with six solid brass spotlights, six hammer stakes for installation, a 150-watt transformer, and bulbs.</p>

At Hoffman Electrical, our electricians take pride in our work.</p>
