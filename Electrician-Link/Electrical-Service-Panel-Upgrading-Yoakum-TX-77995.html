<p>Propane and gas powered generators are good and efficient but compared to diesel generators, they will need more maintenance. Some landscape lighting systems operate on "line voltage," the 120-volt current from your house. AMP® fixtures are built to last as long as the LEDs they house. Smaller, portable generators for home are great for powering the essentials, like the refrigerator and microwave, while large standby power generators can power everything in your house.</p>

Electrical emergencies can be disruptive to your home and business. Programmable timer switches allow you to have more control over when and how your lights turn on and off. The amount would also be much lower if the homeowner does the installation, as you need not allocate an extra amount for the technician who will install the wiring.</p>
