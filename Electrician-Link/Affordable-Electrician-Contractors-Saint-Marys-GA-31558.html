<p>Today, thanks to massive industrial growth that has strained the worlds capacity to produce enough energy, it has become quite obvious that we need to know and understand which are the best diesel backup generators.

I would definitely recommend a generator that either runs on propane or natural gas as those fuels do not degrade over time as gasoline does. Our staff is highly trained and prepared to handle virtually any kind of electrical emergency and will respond day or night.
