Depending on just how your outlets were done, you will may have to nut two blacks together on the first outlet, along with a 6" "pigtail" that goes to the outlet. The average American home is hit by more than 20 power surges every single day. However, if the device is sensitive to fluctuations and performance is sorely affected by fluctuations, you need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
