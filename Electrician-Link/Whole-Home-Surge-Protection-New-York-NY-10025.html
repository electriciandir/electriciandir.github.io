Some landscape lighting systems operate on "line voltage," the 120-volt current from your house. AMP® fixtures are built to last as long as the LEDs they house. Smaller, portable generators for home are great for powering the essentials, like the refrigerator and microwave, while large standby power generators can power everything in your house.</p>
<p>On the circuit breaker (frequently located in a basement or garage) you will need to find the specific room you need to power off.

<p>Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that full-time electricians experienced a work-related injury and illness rate that was higher than the national average.
