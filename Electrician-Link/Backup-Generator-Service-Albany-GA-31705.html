<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets. Low voltage systems run on voltages lower than 30 volts DC (usually 12 or 24 volts) and use a 'Class 2' power source. Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments. Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>
<p>Voltage drop is a LOT more important in low-voltage systems. Because low voltage fluorescent light fittings have a lower power consumption than incandescent or halogens this makes them more desirable. In these cases, the contractor license is issued after the qualifying individual passes the exam. You know when you choose Walter Electric you are choosing a company who values integrity above all else and delivers expert electrical service above and beyond what is expected.</p>
