<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets.

Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>
<p>Voltage drop is a LOT more important in low-voltage systems.
