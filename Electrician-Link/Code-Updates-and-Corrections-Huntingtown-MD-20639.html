All electricians, both residential and industrial, must be licensed by the state in which they work; some states refer to this as certification.

Landscape fixtures are also available in LED, which will use far less power than traditional halogen or incandescent lighting. Electrical panels have evolved over time, and many designs that were common in the mid-20th century no longer meet contemporary electrical needs.</p>
