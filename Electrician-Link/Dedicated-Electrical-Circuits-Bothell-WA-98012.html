<h2>How To Hire Licensed Electrician Service in Bothell</h2>
<p>Electricians need the right tools and equipment to perform their job easily and properly. A boiler feed pump being powered by two 3500 hp induction motors appears to be developing a problem.

Remove about 12 in. of the white outer plastic sheathing from the cable before you push it into the box (Photo 7). Use a stripping tool like ours for 12-2 and 14-2 cable, or an inexpensive ($2.50) sheathing stripper that works on all cables.</p>
