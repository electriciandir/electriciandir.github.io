<p>Electricians need to be strong enough to move heavy components, which may weigh up to 50 pounds. Be wary of items purchased outside or imported into the UK, as these don't always meet national safety standards, and definitely avoid counterfeit electrical goods (such as off-brand hair straighteners), which are the leading cause of electrical shocks and fires. Don't forget that lighting and other electrical circuits for stoves have to be installed by a qualified electrician.</p>
<p>Licenses issued through the Montana State Electrical Board. Using low voltage lights are cheap, and can be moved on the track to establish the type of lighting you prefer.
