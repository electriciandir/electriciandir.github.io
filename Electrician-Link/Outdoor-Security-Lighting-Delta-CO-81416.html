<p>A single lightning strike or other power spiking occurrences that could disrupt the power structure near or in your area can cause damage to expensive appliances. Well in a parallel circuit, each light has its own circuit (or its on hot and neutral wire) and the voltage across each of the components is the same; the current increases, but the voltage stays the same. If your outlets are warm, or extension cords get hot, they are probably overloaded. A new service panel can enhance safety and property value.

The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency.

<p>But many homes built between the 1950s and 1990 still have electrical circuit breakers with Stab-Lok panels, made by the defunct company Federal Pacific. Backup generators cannot simply be plugged into a wall outlet. Electric service panels have a number of different names: fuse box , fuse panel, circuit breaker panel. Your breaker box, also known as the fuse box or electrical panel, is the main control of your home's entire electrical system. The typical cost of repairing damage caused by electrical surges is $500.</p>

Home standby generators are installed permanently, can run on natural gas or propane, and kick on automatically during an outage.

<p>The company creates products and solutions that change and shape consumer lifestyles. For emergencies or day-to-day jobs, Lee Company electricians are here to help. You would never be able to acquire any type of liability insurance as a contractor to do any kind of electrical work without a license, nor would you be able to pull a permit for a homeowner.

<p>Finding yourself in need of the services of a professional electrician is not an everyday occurrence for homeowners or business owners, so many find themselves unsure where to look to find qualified local electricians, how to determine the best electrician for the job, and what certifications and qualifications a professional electrician should have. Before you dive in, take a second to snap a picture of the switches and visible wiring. If you need help marketing backup generators to your customers, we can assist you with that as well.</p>
