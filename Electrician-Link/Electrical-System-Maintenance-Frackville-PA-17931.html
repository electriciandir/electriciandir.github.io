<p>The safety of the system depends first on how well you have maintained the safety valves — your electrical fuses or your circuit breakers. Children and pets have inquisitive, adventurous natures, but unfortunately aren't yet up to speed with electrical safety, making them prime targets for injuries and shocks. If the panel gives off a burning smell, this could be a sign that either there is a bad circuit breaker or that a wire isn't properly connected. An aging or damaged electric panel in your home is ineffective and a potential safety hazard.</p>
