Many injuries occur in the kitchen and bathroom areas, because of their proximity to water and the most common injuries are from electrical appliances, frayed electrical cords and overhead power lines.</p>
<p>A panel upgrade increases electrical capacity. A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a double outlet that has one half permanently on (ready to provide electricity) while the other half can be turned on and off via an ordinary wall switch.

<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings.

We perform a variety of electrical services from fuse box replacement, fuse repair, and electrical panel installation.</p>
<p>If several lights have stopped functioning in a short space of time, it could be a symptom of a deeper problem with the electrical system in your home. Keep in mind that your service panel influences the amount of power available for distribution around your home. If the room light responds perfectly from the wire test, (meaning that a each brief touch of the correct wires either turns the lights on or turns them off) then the switch is the problem and needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Most residential work can be carried out by a licensed electrical contractor who holds an Electrical mechanic licence. We're experts in troubleshooting all types of electrical problems whether it's a loose wire in your light switch or extensive repairs for all the lighting in your home.

Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen. If you are like most people, you are probably aware of some basic electrical knowledge, such as knowing how to flip a breaker and that water and electricity don't mix, but there's also a lot you probably don't know.</p>
<p>A good electrician will offer you a entire line of surge protectors to accommodate your individual requirements and finances. However, this will not protect your electrical outlet, walls, insulation or your appliances from electrical shocks. Lastly, if you live in an area that promotes dark-sky compliance in outdoor lighting, be sure to select fixtures that are specifically rated as dark-sky compliant.
