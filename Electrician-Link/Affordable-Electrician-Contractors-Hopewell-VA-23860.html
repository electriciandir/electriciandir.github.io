After taking the assessment, respondents are directed to ESFI's comprehensive library of safety resources and links to help them find the information to take the next step in improving the electrical safety of their workplace. In this illustration, you can see the red hot lead” wires of the dimmer are connected to the inbound black wire from the electrical source (the electrical panel) and the black wire that goes to the light fixture's black wire which, in this case, is a white wire that has been taped with black electrical tape.</p>
<p>Critical electrical systems like cooling and lighting, alarms, computers and data storage units, refrigerators, and medical equipment can be protected and can continue to function with the protection of a standby generator solution from Stuart Services.
