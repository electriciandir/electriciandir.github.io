<p>If the contactor does operate and the motor is not running, the controller should be shut off to prevent damaging the motor. Plus you still gain the protection from power surges that an ordinary surge protector offers. Circuit breakers come in different shapes and sizes and a person should choose the one that suits the electric equipment at home. A standby generator can energize a house for days after a blackout. It is best if this outlet is on a circuit intended for outlets.</p>

<p>When you put both the switched wire and the hot wire onto an outlet without the tab broken it will remain hot at all times. In your outlet, it is the white wire that terminates on the outlet.

<p>This approach should be substantially less costly and troublesome than attempting to convert all of the switches in the home to 120V design - that would require re-wiring those areas in the home with new 120V wires. Gasoline generators gives the most power per weight unit but require frequent maintenance. They are able to do this by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. So to keep everyone safe, landscape lighting manufacturers settled on 12 volts as a standard.</p>
