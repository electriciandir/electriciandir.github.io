<p>Hiring the right electrician takes some time. Our experienced electricians have years of local expertise and the right tools to properly handle your panel box services. Sounds like all the outlets and lights are being fed from the one switch, but only some were actually using it. Take the two wires that attached to the same timer wire, and splice them together with a wire nut, along with a new 6" piece of wire. Type 1 devices are installed at the utility meter, Type 2 devices are mounted to the load side of the main service panel and Type 3 devices are typically plugged into electronic equipment within the home.</p>

<p>This is something that needs to be approved by the power company (A.P.S. or S.R.P.). You can call them up and tell them you are going to have a service panel upgrade done and need to verify that your chosen location will be approved by them.
