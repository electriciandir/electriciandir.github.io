It may be a faulty or an old switch in which case it will need replacing or it could just be that the wires or terminals have become loose in which case it is just a matter of tightening the screws. Standby generators should be started up once a week and run for 15 minutes to "exercise" them - making sure they're ready when needed.</p>
