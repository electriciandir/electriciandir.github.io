Even the simplest projects involve working with systems (and power) that could literally send your business up in flames. It covers an analytical method for troubleshooting electrical power distribution system, electrical control systems, electrical motors, transformers and switchgear. Landscape lighting designers know that unless they hide the source of the lights, viewers may be distracted or discomforted.
