If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>
