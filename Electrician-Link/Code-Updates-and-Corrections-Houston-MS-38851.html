Excess current could have been caused by: overload on the load; short circuit between the wires, grounded wires, short circuit in the load, ground in the load, voltage spike, voltage droop, etc.</p>
<p>If a 14-2 cable is run from the panel to the outlet, then a 15 amp circuit breaker is the largest that can be used to protect that circuit.

<p>Neglecting your home's electrical system can have devastating effects. All of the circuits to your home will be replaced to ensure that they are energy-compliant and that they won't be overloaded once the electricity is free-flowing again. But with most, you take the connector at the base of each light and slip it around the electrical wire until you hear a snap. If not, then the light switch will simply turn off the whole outlet, as well as the entire circuit following that outlet.</p>
