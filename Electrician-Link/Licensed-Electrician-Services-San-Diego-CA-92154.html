Ambient light is often found in the form of recessed lighting or other types of ceiling lights.

But before you replace it you need to determine whether it is the light switch that is faulty or if the wiring is the problem.</p>
<p>Because this type of lighting is installed near or in water, special precautions must be taken to ensure safety and minimize the risk of electrocution.
