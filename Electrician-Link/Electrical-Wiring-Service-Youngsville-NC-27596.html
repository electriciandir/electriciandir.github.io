The goal of learning about electrical safety is to not become an expert in electricity or electrical repair but to gain enough knowledge to be able to react in an emergency. Set a voltage tester to "Volts" and touch the tip of each tester-wire to a terminal screw at opposite sides of the switch-outlet.</p>
<p>You must have four years of experience as a foreman, contractor, journeyman, owner-builder or supervisor. Fluorescent lamps are used extensively in commercial lighting fixtures for a number of reasons.

In a 12 VAC circuit the voltage drop from the low voltage lighting transformer, that is converting or stepping down the 120 VAC to 12 VAC to the light fixtures can have a major impact on the quality and level of light that you and your guests will see.</p>
