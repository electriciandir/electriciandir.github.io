<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>

The main thing to watch out for is having too many wires in one electrical box. Maintenance Electrician - You must show proof of 48 months of experience in multiple categories. Buy the appropriate transformer for your outdoor lights.</p>
