<p>If you want a whole house generator that can power 90-100% of your home on natural gas or propane, call a pro from the start. Plugging too many items into outlets is the cause of many house fires. Older homes may have small electrical panels with minimal loads that may not be able to service high-power, modern appliances. When electrical contractors have a good understanding of what a job involves, they can then make plans on how to proceed.
