That way the switched part of the circuit is still intact, still not connected to the permanently hot wires, and can still function for the rest of the outlets on the circuit. The National Fire Protection Association's report on home electrical fires shows that electrical failures and malfunctions are now the biggest contributors to the start of a home fire.</p>
<p>Regular maintenance ensures your generator will never fail to operate as issues such as broken parts, electric malfunctions, and wear and tear as a result of age and usage, can be identified and fixed before they become a problem.
