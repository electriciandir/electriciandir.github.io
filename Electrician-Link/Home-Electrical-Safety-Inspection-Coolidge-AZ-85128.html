Some prefer to have slightly brighter lights that allow them to see their entire yard, this gives them a sense of security; others prefer a much more subdued light that creates an ambience rather than a light show. An automatic backup generator turns on within seconds of the power going out, and when the return of utility power is sensed, it automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode, ready for the next outage.</p>
<p>The AFCI receptacle will provide downstream protection for the majority of the existing circuit and the new extended wiring too. It was really helpful to learn that electrical repairs like replacing a light switch or changing a plug on a lead are best left to professionals.
