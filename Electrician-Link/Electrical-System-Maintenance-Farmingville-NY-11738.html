The average cost to replace a fuse box with a breaker panel is $1,100 to $4,000 and depends on what capacity the new breaker panel can handle. Home standby generators, always installed on the exterior of the home, come in various materials, but premium models may offer aluminum enclosures better suited to withstand high winds.</p>

<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>

It is also possible that the original wiring used a black wire to splice to the black panel wire, returning a white wire (that should have been painted black!) to the outlet - if that is the case then that "white that should be black" should terminate on the brass screws of the outlet, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity.
