Whether you need one technician or an entire team of electrical specialist, all of our staff is courteous and well trained. You can be fined $22,000 as an individual or $110,000 as a company for doing unlicensed electrical work. A training licence is valid for the period of apprenticeship or traineeship. Determining the height in which you would like the light to be installed will help to narrow down the choice as well as the overall design of the home.

This Briggs & Stratton standby generator is fitted with a commercial Vanguard engine that provides whole-house power to the tune of 20 kilowatts on liquid propane and 18 kilowatts on natural gas. Downed power lines can energize the ground up to 35 feet away. Unlike small standby generators that can only use natural gas or propane, whole home generators also have a diesel option which makes power more accessible.</p>
<p>Electricity flows in through your electrical meter before reaching the circuit breaker panel where it is then routed for distribution among the various rooms of your home. And unless you buy a large generator (they're available with more than 15,000 watts), you're still limited in what you can power. Keep yourself and any equipment at least 10 feet away from power lines. Given that, you must turn off the circuit breaker before you start any electrical job.
