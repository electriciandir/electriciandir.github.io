The utility professionals who work near overhead power lines must wear appropriate safety clothing, use tested safety equipment, and take training to be able to do the installation, maintenance, and repair work they do. It is vital that safety equipment is regularly tested as even non-conductive materials, such as rubber, wood, or plastic, can conduct electricity if damp, dirty, or damaged.</p>
