GFCIs constantly monitor the electricity flowing in a circuit. Finally, enjoy your landscape lighting into the evening hours with comfortable and stylish outdoor furniture including sofas, lounge chairs and hammocks.

A big move forward for LED lighting was the advent of modular LED lighting, where key components of the lighting can be replaced rather than the whole fixture. To check the fuse in line 1, place the voltmeter across the line fuse as shown at position B between L1 L2. A voltage reading shows a good fuse in L1. Likewise, check the other two fuses between L1 L3 and L2 L3. A no voltage reading would show a faulty fuse.</p>
