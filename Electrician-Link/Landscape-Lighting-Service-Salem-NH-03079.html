Licensed electricians are also the only individuals who can authoritatively inspect wiring and rectify faulty installations.</p>
<p>However, the electrician also needs to know beforehand exactly which switch is directly linked to the specific light fixture to be replaced. Its diminutive structure, however, does not mean that its surge protection capabilities have been compromised. Simply plug a Switcheroo into your switched outlet, and then another Switcheroo into as many outlets that you want to turn on and off with your existing switch.
