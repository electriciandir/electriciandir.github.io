<p>Modern generators are more efficient than ever and can create an electrical output that can power your home. With circuit breakers, the breaker will flip off if it cannot handle the amount of electricity that is flowing through it, so you can usually just flip it back on. NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
<p>An electrical fuse is essential for protecting your electrical system during surges and power fluctuations. In addition all of our contractors are licensed, bonded & insured. The National Electric Code (NEC) requires that low voltage power supplies and electrical wiring be Class 2 compliant.

An automatic backup generator turns on within seconds of the power going out, and when the return of utility power is sensed, it automatically shuts down and returns to standby mode, ready for the next outage.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2017 more than 900 people died of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning while using portable generators, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
