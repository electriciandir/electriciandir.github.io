Most transformers are equipped with a 24-hour timer that allows users to decide when the lights go on and off automatically. In older houses that were built before household electrical wiring was common and with stone walls too hard to cut recesses, the simplest solution is to use what are known as ‘surface back boxes'. The effectiveness of low voltage lighting systems have drastically improved over the years. Unless you are simply plugging in a surge protector to valuable electronics, or swapping a light bulb, opting for a licensed, professional electrician is in your best interest.</p>
