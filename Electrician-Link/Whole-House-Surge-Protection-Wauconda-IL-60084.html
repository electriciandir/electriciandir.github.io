Many injuries occur in the kitchen and bathroom areas, because of their proximity to water and the most common injuries are from electrical appliances, frayed electrical cords and overhead power lines.</p>

<p>If it is a 15 amp breaker, you will need either that same 12-3 or 14-3 wire (14 gauge, 3-wire, plus ground). Advances in technology have resulted in portable generators with power output levels similar to stationary generators giving them a wide range of uses.

Your circuit breaker should be labeled and diagrammed somewhere in the service panel, most often inside the cover lid. Even the most effective surge protectors can not protect equipment from the sudden increase in electrical pressure of millions of volts that lightning can supply. A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
<p>This is the comprehensive guide to all types of electrical switches and sockets that are commonly used in your home. Conduct generator maintenance and repairs as needed. AC motors represent industry's workhorse in all applications. With their low wattage and longevity, LED fixtures can work well to supply emergency lighting.
