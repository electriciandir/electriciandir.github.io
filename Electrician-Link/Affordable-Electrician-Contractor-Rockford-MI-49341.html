<p>Joseph T. Berrena Mechanicals, Inc. A homeowner can illuminate artwork with LED lighting without worrying about the colors fading. After carefully evaluating all options, including whether to refurbish the existing circuit breakers or opt for a total replacement, the decision was made to modernize the existing switchgear with new Masterpact NW direct replacement circuit breakers.
