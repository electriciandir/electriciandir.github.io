Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed. An electrical contractor is permitted to apply for a permit from the local governmental jurisdiction to engage in electrical wiring at a specific job site. First, find a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet to act as the connection point between your home and the outdoor lights.</p>

On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>

It is also possible that the original wiring used a black wire to splice to the black panel wire, returning a white wire (that should have been painted black!) to the outlet - if that is the case then that "white that should be black" should terminate on the brass screws of the outlet, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>Check to see whether the outlet is switch-controlled and that the switch is on. Some outlets turn on or off via wall light switches. Circuit breakers act as an automatic shut-off for dangerous electrical problems, such as overloaded circuits and short circuits. A properly sized and installed generator can make the difference between being out of power during the storm or safe and comfortable.
