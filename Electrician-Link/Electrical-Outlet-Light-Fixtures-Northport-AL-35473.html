As always take any advise with a grain of salt and read the instructions that came with the light fixtures and through the salt over your left shoulder.</p>

Fans, pumps, motors, generators, turbines and other rotating equipment have a baseline vibration signature.</p>
<p>Though a home standby generator is a fairly large investment, it could truly be a saving grace when power outages occur.
