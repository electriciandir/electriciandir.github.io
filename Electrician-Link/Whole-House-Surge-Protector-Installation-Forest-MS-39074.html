Working as anelectrician is one of the best jobs you can secure with only a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>
<p>However, there may be local electrician licensing requirements so make sure to check these before you begin work. Licenses are issued by the State Electrical Board of North Dakota. In other jurisdictions, you would be considered fully licensed and wouldn't even require the general oversight of a master electrician.
