<p>Here is a project for do-it-yourself handy person who is looking for how to build a solar power generator. The same can be said if you do have a modern circuit breaker box, but find that you have to reset your circuit breakers too often. The hot wire and the switched wire are connected with that tab, making both wires hot all the time, whether in that outlet or another on the same switch. Creative lighting can produce dramatic effects that show off the beauty of your home and accentuate the landscape.

At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
