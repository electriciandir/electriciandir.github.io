Ignoring these signs can result in serious and costly consequences that range from a burnt power outlet, melted electrical wiring, or damage to plugged-in devices to more serious risks like deadly electrocution and electrical fires. All outdoor outlets should have waterproof covers.</p>
<p>Many protectors will connect to all three in pairs (line-neutral, line-ground and neutral-ground), because there are conditions, such as lightning, where both line and neutral have high voltage spikes that need to be shorted to ground. The inexpensive, portable generators are almost a no-brainer to have around for the occasional outage. Some states also have multiple levels of master electrician licensing.

This diagram shows the wiring for multiple switched outlets on one switch.</p>
<p>Electricians may need to take classes to learn about changes to the National Electrical Code, and they often complete regular safety programs, manufacturer-specific training, and management training courses. A joule rating of at least 600 should be able to handle most household surges. Important note: NEVER increase the size of a panel breaker on a circuit that keeps tripping.
