Many times when a basement is finished after a home was built or circuits are added at a later date, the electrician‚Äù does not install the correct breakers.</p>

With a generator, you'll never lose time or money due to a power outage again. Because electricity travels on the outside of copper wire, wires are insulated to protect against fire and shock. Leave one bare ground wire long, and snip the rest to 6 in. beyond the box. If a power line is broken stay as far away as possible to reduce the risk of electrical shock.</p>
<p>Check to see whether the outlet is switch-controlled and that the switch is on. Some outlets turn on or off via wall light switches.

A properly sized and installed generator can make the difference between being out of power during the storm or safe and comfortable. Therefore, install a lighting fixture on all entry points of your house.</p>
