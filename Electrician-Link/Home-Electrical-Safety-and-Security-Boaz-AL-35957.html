Extension cords - Never substitute for permanent wiring. If the yard is full of trees or does not receive sufficient sun light due to surrounding buildings, the solar landscape light will not function for the specified duration.</p>

<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems.

We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>

Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel.

<p>The Licensed Electrical Contractor must also meet other obligations related to conducting electrical work, including supervision, administration and safety requirements. Choosing the route in which your power cables will be placed is also a critical aspect of a successful wiring layout.
