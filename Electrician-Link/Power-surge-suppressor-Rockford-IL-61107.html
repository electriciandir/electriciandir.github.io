If you have electronics plugged into power strips, make sure they have surge protection as well (not all power strips do!). Circuit breakers are designed to trip when overloaded or when there is a short circuit or electrical problem. Use a portable ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) cord if your outdoor outlets don't have GFCIs.</p>

Standby generators often run on propane, natural gas, or a combination of fuels. We take pride in the diversity of our commercial lighting offerings. Upgrading one's electrical panel is the best way to ensure electricity is being used efficiently.</p>

Be sure to tighten all wire nuts or terminal screws firmly and give each wire a tug test as you connect them.</p>
