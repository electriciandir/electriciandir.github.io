Gasoline generators gives the most power per weight unit but require frequent maintenance. They are able to do this by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. So to keep everyone safe, landscape lighting manufacturers settled on 12 volts as a standard.</p>
<p>Transformer - an electrical power source; this device is required to operate any low voltage fixture, in this case 12-volts. The function of the control system is to supply control power to operate critical devices such as protective relays, alarms and status indicators, supervisory and communications equipment, and switchgear operating circuits.
