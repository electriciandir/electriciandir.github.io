<p>If you want to protect your electronic equipment from sudden damage or failure, then you may want to consider using a surge protector. You will need to bend or break off one of the new electrical box tabs in the back to run the wire through.

It may be a faulty or an old switch in which case it will need replacing or it could just be that the wires or terminals have become loose in which case it is just a matter of tightening the screws. Standby generators should be started up once a week and run for 15 minutes to "exercise" them - making sure they're ready when needed.</p>
