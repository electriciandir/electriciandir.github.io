Some electrical contractors have their own training programs, which are not recognized apprenticeship programs but include both classroom and on-the-job training.</p>
<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock. Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician. The result of a properly installed system is a beautifully illuminated landscape and a safe installation. Photocells can be used to automatically switch lights on and off at dusk and dawn, and some light fittings come with these built in. Similarly PIR detectors switch lights on when someone approaches, and these are often built in to security lights.</p>
