Your circuit breaker should be labeled and diagrammed somewhere in the service panel, most often inside the cover lid. Even the most effective surge protectors can not protect equipment from the sudden increase in electrical pressure of millions of volts that lightning can supply. A conventional circuit breaker can't detect the low-level arcing (a spark-generating short circuit) that can occur on frayed or cut wires.</p>
<p>Most circuit breaker panels that need repairs often will most likely need to be replaced.

<p>Over time, however, panels can age, and their components wear out, which will necessitate repairs. You will also need a firm understanding of Ohms law (Volt x Amps = Watts) and how it works in relation to laying out the wiring for the lighting system. These generators are intended for portable backup use and require regular maintenance and tests to ensure they are ready for an outage.
