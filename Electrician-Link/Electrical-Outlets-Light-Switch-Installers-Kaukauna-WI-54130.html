<p>If the main is a breaker, the overload rating size is typically on the handle, or immediately adjacent, e.g. 200, 175, or 150 (Amps). With a generator, you'll never lose time or money due to a power outage again. Because electricity travels on the outside of copper wire, wires are insulated to protect against fire and shock.
