Surge protection can extend the lifetime of sensitive electronic equipment by protecting it against harmful power surges. This guide will teach you the best method for installing a low-voltage lighting system in your landscape. A smart dimmer switch lets you adjust the brightness of lights from an app on your phone and even set custom schedules so lights come on when you need them and turn off when you don't.</p>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>

The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets.

As you add electrical wiring, you'll need another switch to control that part of the home. A surge protective device (SPD) is designed to protect electrical systems and equipment from surge and transient events by limiting transient voltages and diverting surge currents.</p>
<p>A random spark, an unusual smell coming from an electrical outlet, a complete power outage: these things can occur suddenly, day or night. Voltage drop occurs when power is lost between the source and the fixture. Outlets near water should be GFI-type outlets. Low voltage systems run on voltages lower than 30 volts DC (usually 12 or 24 volts) and use a 'Class 2' power source. Electricians use a range of hand and power tools and instruments. Whether it's a relatively simple repair job or a complete electrical installation in a brand new building, you simply must have the right contractor working with you.</p>
