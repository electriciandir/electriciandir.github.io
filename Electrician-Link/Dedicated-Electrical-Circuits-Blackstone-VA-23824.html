This will help shunt the surge caused by the appliances from the rest of the house, which will help reduce the risk of fire and possibly other electrical meltdowns. Southern Lights can make sure that your landscape lighting always looks spectacular and is checked on an ongoing basis to prevent problems. If you're seeing signs of bad wiring or other potential electrical safety issues, the trained electricians at AAA Service are here to help. Black wiring in your home is known as hot wiring, while white wires are considered neutral ones.</p>
<p>Licensed electricians are also familiar with the local building codes that establish the number and placement of residential outlets and switches. The switch or outlet is anchored in place with a screw at either end. The ground wire is connected to the metal parts within an appliance as a safety feature, in case the hot or neutral wires somehow come in contact with metal parts.
