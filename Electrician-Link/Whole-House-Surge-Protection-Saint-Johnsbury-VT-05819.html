If something falls between the wall and the plug (like a coin for instance), it will hit the ground first, then slide to either the load side or the neutral side therefor not causing a short between neutral and load which can cause a fire.</p>
<p>Combustibles - Keep area around electrical equipment clear of combustibles such as sawdust, paper, cardboard, and flammable liquids.

<p>Having a standby generator in your home means you can keep the lights on when the power goes out. Surge protectors should always have a polarized plug (with one of the blades larger than the other) or a three-prong grounded plug. Whatever you do, don't overload your plugs or extension cords.
