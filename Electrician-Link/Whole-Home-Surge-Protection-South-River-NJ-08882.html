Each division evaluates applicants for licensure, conducts examinations, issues and renews licenses, evaluates the practice of licensees, takes disciplinary action against licensees, and enforces the requirements for licensure.</p>
<p>We get it, there can be a ton of confusion when it comes to different types of electricians. If the lights and receptacles are wired with a multi-wire circuit than it doesn't matter as both circuits, if wired correctly on the two pole circuit breakers, will shut off anyway. You must still remove the red (or whatever color is switched) wires and splice them together with a wire nut if there is more than one of them. Immediately addressing the problem with your electrical panel will help you avoid emergency situations and potential issues such as power surges, electrical shocks, and circuit overloads.</p>

Make sure you review this article to see how all the connections should be made, including ground wires.

When the automatic transfer switch senses that the generator is running and producing power it automatically disconnects the utility power line and reconnects to the generator power line, providing emergency power to your a home or building within seconds of a sudden power outage.</p>
