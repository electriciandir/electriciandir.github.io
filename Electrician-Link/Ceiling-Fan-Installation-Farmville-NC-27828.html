<p>I'm not sure if you're aware of the fact that inside your home are a lot of sensitive electronics. A surge protector attempts to limit the voltage supplied to an electric device by either blocking or shorting to ground any unwanted voltages above a safe threshold. In this article series we describe low-voltage wiring, controls, and power supplies operating usually at 24VAC and that in turn are used to control line-voltage devices operating usually at 120VAC or 240VAC.
