<p>This approach should be substantially less costly and troublesome than attempting to convert all of the switches in the home to 120V design - that would require re-wiring those areas in the home with new 120V wires. Gasoline generators gives the most power per weight unit but require frequent maintenance. They are able to do this by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. So to keep everyone safe, landscape lighting manufacturers settled on 12 volts as a standard.</p>

<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem.
