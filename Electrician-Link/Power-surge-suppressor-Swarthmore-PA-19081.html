Splice into the permanently hot wire, putting it to the second switch. Always assume that power lines, even if they have come down, carry an electrical charge. Many devices use wall warts - plugs that convert AC power into DC power and look like little boxes with electrical prongs sticking out. When it comes to natural gas, as long as you have it coming to your property, there is no reason why you shouldn't be using a generator powered by it. You will basically have unlimited fuel, and not have to worry about refilling, or running out.</p>
