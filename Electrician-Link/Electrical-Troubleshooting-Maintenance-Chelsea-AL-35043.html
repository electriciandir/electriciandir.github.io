One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it. Not only does this save you power by reducing any phantom drain (the amount of energy the device consumes even when not actively in use), but unplugging unused appliances also protects them from overheating or power surges. The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting is a great deterrent to thieves who thrive under the cover of darkness. Also, replace any frayed power cords on electrical appliances you use. Your electrical panel trips all the time. Whole House power supply can power a house up to 12,000 square feet with two 5 ton air conditioners or an electric oven and smaller home appliances.
