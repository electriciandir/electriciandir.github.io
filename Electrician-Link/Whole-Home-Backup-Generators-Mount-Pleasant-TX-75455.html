Arc faults happen when electricity crosses a gap between damaged wiring such as loose, corroded, or overloaded connections in walls, appliances, and cords.</p>

You will, of course, need an already existing outlet that is half switched or will need to add a switch yourself. Neatly fold the wires into the box in this order: grounds, neutrals and then hots.
