In a surge protector, the main power line (known as the hot wire or live wire) has an extra connection (a kind of "side road") linked to it that feeds to the ground wire (sometimes also called the Earth wire; the protective wire in an electric circuit that sends any unwanted current safely into the earth).</p>
