<p>Even though Tables 11(A) and 11(B) in chapter 9 apply to Class 2 and Class 3 power supplies and not specifically to low-voltage lighting systems, these tables can provide direction and information for acceptable ac and dc voltage levels for both dry and wet locations.

<p>A full electrical wiring inspection is the only way to know for sure where the problem originates. If your lights come with press-on fittings—the type that bite through the insulation and into the landscape lighting wire to make their connection—cut them off and use the wire connectors shown in Photo 4. Your connections will be more solid and longer lasting. Up lighting uses fixtures that are placed at ground level and angled upward to highlight an object.
