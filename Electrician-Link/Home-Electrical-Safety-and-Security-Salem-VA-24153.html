For homes larger than 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, you may even need two breaker panels, a 200 Amp one and an additional 100 to 200 Amp panel to supplement it. Obviously then, the larger the number, the greater the amount of protection the device can offer.</p>

<p>There are supposedly various reasons behind this light installation problem. Older appliances could have grounding issues that might put you at risk for a shock. Install an interlock device instead, which costs $100-$200 less than a transfer switch and can be installed in less time by an electrician.
