Heavy covering of wires can cause the cords to overheat, which could lead to an electrical fire. Done right, landscape lighting makes the best of what you've got by highlighting your home's architectural features and drawing attention to prized plantings and trees. Electrical wall outlets also should be mounted in a plastic or metal junction box inside the wall.</p>
