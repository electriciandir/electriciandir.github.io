One of the simplest electrical safety tips is also one of the easiest to forget: when an appliance is not in use, unplug it.

The auxiliary contacts are then available for use in the control circuit of the original machine or another machine.</p>

But with most, you take the connector at the base of each light and slip it around the electrical wire until you hear a snap. If not, then the light switch will simply turn off the whole outlet, as well as the entire circuit following that outlet.</p>
<p>This creates a major safety issue for both the house and people who may come in contact with the wiring. Note: most states require a certain percentage of electrician training hours be spent in commercial or industrial installation.
