Especially if you get a tough brand, like the Monster surge protector, you'll feel extra safe. Homeowners might visit their electrical service panel box no more than once a year.</p>

Furthermore, NEC Sections 411.5(A) and 250.22(4) do not permit the secondary of a low-voltage lighting system transformer to be grounded for any reason. When the low-voltage lighting system is being installed in permanent cabinets with a remote power source connected to fixed wiring, these products are required to comply with UL 2108 for low-voltage incandescent luminaires and luminaire fittings.</p>
