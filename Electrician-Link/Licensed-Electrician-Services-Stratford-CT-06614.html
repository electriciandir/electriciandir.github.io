This actually isn't too rare, as outlet junction boxes sometimes serve as junction boxes for other circuits passing through. A switch counts as two wires. I would definitely recommend a generator that either runs on propane or natural gas as those fuels do not degrade over time as gasoline does. Our staff is highly trained and prepared to handle virtually any kind of electrical emergency and will respond day or night. Electrical Contractor License: Only a licensed master electrician or a company that employs one can apply for it.</p>
