Have the lighting professional take care of making these adjustments for you, and leave the programming instructions with you. Now use a square-blade shovel to cut a 2- to 3-inch-deep trench along the line where you want the light fixtures. Condition of existing wiring and fixtures.

Inspect extension cords for broken connectors, damaged insulation and missing hardware before each use. Outdoor low voltage lighting provide a pleasant alternative to glaring floodlights.</p>
<p>Connect the black wire coming from the light fixture (not the hot wire) to either one of the black screws on the switch—it doesn't matter in this case.
