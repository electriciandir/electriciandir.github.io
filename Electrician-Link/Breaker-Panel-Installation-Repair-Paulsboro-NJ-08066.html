<p>A battery backup surge protector is the perfect solution for the persistent threat of power outages and data loss. Requirements vary, but usually call for the completion of an approved training program, work as a journey worker and passing a test on electrical codes. Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home.
