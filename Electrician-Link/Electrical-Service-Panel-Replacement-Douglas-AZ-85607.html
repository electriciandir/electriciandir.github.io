Above: This wire was a short section of extension cord that had been used to connect a permanently-mounted fluorescent light fixture to power by plugging it into a wall-mounted electrical receptacle.</p>
<p>Watch out: we do not wire fixed lighting fixtures such as ceiling lights on the same circuit as electrical receptacles ("wall plugs"). But depending on how the building is wired, you may not have an acceptable neutral wire, and in some still older circuits you may not have a safe ground wire.

These include old wiring, worn outlets, outdated fixtures and damaged circuits. Most times, it is not the goal of electricians to have your homes electrical wiring done wrongly.</p>
