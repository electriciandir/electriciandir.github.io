<p>As anyone who has been the victim of a power surge or a lightning strike can tell you, using HDTV surge protection in your home is a must. This guide will focus on the requirements for electrical journeyman and master electrician. Some are designed to immediately turn on in the event of a power outage and prevent computer data from being lost and allow you to continue using appliances or electronics like there's no power interruption at all. A less expensive way to go - and your only option if you've purchased the generator online - is to hire a plumber to connect the unit to its fuel source (usually propane or natural gas, though some run on diesel) and an electrician to hook it into your house's power supply.</p>
