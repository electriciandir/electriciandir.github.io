Let us start with the initial note as to what is lightning and why lightning protection is so important. Prior to restoring the primary voltage source, set the DMM to continuity mode (ohms) and verify at the motor starter line contactors that there is not a phase-to-phase short or a phase-to-ground short.</p>
<p>An SPD can damp the spike down to a value compatible with that which most connected appliances can withstand: approximately 1.5 kV. All devices within 10 meters of the switchboard are effectively protected. Even better, opt for a quality battery backup unit (#ad) instead of a surge protector. It might be possible, but it would require that each outlet have the same wires in it. A half hot requires two colored wires, usually black and red, but it could be two black wires.</p>
<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets.
