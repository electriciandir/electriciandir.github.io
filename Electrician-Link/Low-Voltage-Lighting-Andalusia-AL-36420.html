If you are having a problem and you reset the breaker, but it will not remain that way, or it does not restore power, chances are there is a problem with the electrical panel.</p>
<p>It's often also called the main breaker box, the fuse box, a distribution panel, a load center and even a breaker panel. Electrical wiring problems in old properties are generally caused by natural means like pest infestation, damaged and dilapidated walls resulting exposure to environmental hazards and sometimes theft (the last one may sound ridiculous but it does happen).

Our licensed electrician will perform a thorough examination of the issue and let you know exactly what the problem is and how much repairs will cost.</p>
<h3>Selecting The Best AV Surge Protector in Andalusia AL</h3>
<p>This could be a third defense against surge protection or a first defense if you can't or don't want to spend the money for #1 and #2. A good rule of thumb is to use less than 90% of a transformer's capacity; this will increase the life of both the transformer and the light fixtures that are attached to it. Instead, you must have a generator transfer switch installed in advance. For homes with existing standby generators, these units do require replacement over time.</p>
