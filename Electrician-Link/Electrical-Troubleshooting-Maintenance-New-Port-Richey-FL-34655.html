<p>Many technical schools offer diploma or certificate programs that can prepare individuals for entry-level work as an electrician's apprentice.

All our Emergency Electricians are City & Guilds qualified, work within the strictest guidelines of Health & Safety. It is also possible that the original wiring used a black wire to splice to the black panel wire, returning a white wire (that should have been painted black!) to the outlet - if that is the case then that "white that should be black" should terminate on the brass screws of the outlet, not the silver ones.</p>
<p>Check to see whether the outlet is switch-controlled and that the switch is on. Some outlets turn on or off via wall light switches. Circuit breakers act as an automatic shut-off for dangerous electrical problems, such as overloaded circuits and short circuits. A properly sized and installed generator can make the difference between being out of power during the storm or safe and comfortable. Therefore, install a lighting fixture on all entry points of your house.</p>
<p>And even if your breaker box is just getting old, it's a good idea to have an electrician look at it so that you can plan ahead and do the upgrades before you have an electrical problem. If you are noticing frequent circuit breaker trips, it may be coming from an old panel that cannot deliver enough electrical power for a modern home. They come in different sizes, and it's important to make sure the right size wire is connected to the right size circuit breaker.</p>
