Home standby generators will turn on and test themselves once a week for a few minutes to make sure everything is working properly. When an electrical switch is opened or closed, an arc, or discharge of electricity across a circuit, occurs. Sterlite Power commissioned its fifth project. Or if the top and bottom outlets of a duplex receptacle are powered by two different circuits, the hot tab and possibly the neutral tab will be removed. If the switch is grounded, remove the grounding wire last.</p>
