<p>A battery backup surge protector is the perfect solution for the persistent threat of power outages and data loss. Requirements vary, but usually call for the completion of an approved training program, work as a journey worker and passing a test on electrical codes. Your electrical panel takes electricity originating from the electric company and distributes it throughout your home. It offers more protection than a standard circuit breaker, and plug-in RCDs can cost as little as £10 (although fixed devices provide even greater safety).

Electrical contractor licenses typically need to be renewed on an annual basis. In order to do this, you must have good wiring design (load-wise) and ensure power sources are situated around the property to allow all wire runs to be within 200' of the transformer.</p>
