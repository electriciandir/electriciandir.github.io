Once you fulfill all the hours and other requirements of your apprenticeship, you can take the test to become a journeyman electrician, also sometimes simply called a licensed electrician. You'll also want to keep in mind that the 8000 watt rating is only in effect when using propane, if you tap into the natural gas you're looking at a maximum rating of 6000 watts. It comes with six solid brass spotlights, six hammer stakes for installation, a 150-watt transformer, and bulbs.</p>

<p>Yet every time you flip a light switch or use your toaster, you are drawing on your home's internal wiring—and that can cause big problems if your wiring is old or damaged. Turn off the breaker for the electrical circuit to the switch-outlet at the electrical panel. Electricians perform tests and use the results to diagnose problems.

<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
