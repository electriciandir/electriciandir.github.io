A half-hot (or switched) outlet is a double outlet that has one half permanently on (ready to provide electricity) while the other half can be turned on and off via an ordinary wall switch. Remove the switched wire from the outlet and cap it off with a wire nut (if there are two of them, splice them together). This can prevent data and power loss during the transfer of power to the generator. You must have had a minimum of 8,000 hours of experience.</p>
