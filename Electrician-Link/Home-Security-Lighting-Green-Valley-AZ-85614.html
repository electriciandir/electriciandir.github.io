<h2>How To Hire Certified Electrician Service in Green Valley</h2>
<p>How many of us have waited until our computer, television, or other electrical apparatus was zapped by a rogue current and it resulted in replacement or repair due to an electrical surge? After completing this course, participants should be able to determine current and voltage values for an AC sine wave; explain how resistance, inductance, and capacitance affect AC circuits; explain how to calculate power in AC circuits and how to adjust power by correctly selecting and sizing circuit components; and describe the construction, operation, and use of various types of transformers. Damage from lightning strikes occurs when wires exceed recommended distances or pass between buildings.</p>
<p>The short answer is NO. At least not any surge protector that you can buy for the inside of your house. The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.
