<p>Having a backup power generator is a necessity for emergency services that have to keep working even if the power goes out. The white wire from the switch to the receptacle would have been rewired to be used as a neutral. Because your lights are in the gardens, they are near the plant material, which grows and changes with the seasons, dropping plant material onto and near the fixtures, and can obscure the intended light output. Once the prerequisites are met, you will receive the , or Professional Engineer title that allows you to practice electrical engineering in Canada. NEC 411.2 also provides basic information on the method of converting line voltage to low voltage for these low-voltage systems.</p>
<p>The advantages of halogen are the cost of the fixtures (they are one of the cheapest), and the quality of light. If you notice lights dimming or flickering when a large appliance kicks on, that means they're on the same circuit and the appliance takes electrical current away from the lights when it turns on.
